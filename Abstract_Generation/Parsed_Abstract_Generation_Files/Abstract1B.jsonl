The involvement of LPA(18:1(9Z)/0:0) in cardiolipin biosynthesis has been previously reported. However, the specific role of this enzyme in the formation of different cardiolipin species remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the involvement of LPA(18:1(9Z)/0:0) in the biosynthesis of various cardiolipin species.\n\nMethods: We used a combination of molecular and biochemical techniques to analyze the role of LPA(18:1(9Z)/0:0) in cardiolipin biosynthesis. We first identified the specific cardiolipin species formed by LPA(18:1(9Z)/0:0) using mass spectrometry and enzyme kinetic assays. We then investigated the effects of LPA(18:1(9Z)/0:0) inhibition on cardiolipin biosynthesis using knockout and overexpression approaches. Finally, we analyzed the functional consequences of altered cardiolipin biosynthesis on mitochondrial function and cellular bioenergetics.\n\nResults: Our results showed that LPA(18:1(9Z)/0:0) is specifically involved in the biosynthesis of three cardiolipin species, namely CL(i-14:0/a-15:0/a-17:0/i-24:0), CL(a-13:0/i-15:0/i-17:0/i-19:0), and CL(i-14:0/i-15:0/18:2(9Z,11Z)/i-21:0).

The production of these compounds in kiwi fruit has not been previously studied.\n\nMethods: We conducted an in vitro study to investigate the production of GHB and LGSA in kiwi fruit. Fresh kiwi fruits were homogenized and incubated with specific enzymes to initiate the production of these compounds. The concentration of GHB and LGSA in the extracts was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).\n\nResults: Our results showed that kiwi fruit has the potential to produce significant amounts of both GHB and LGSA. The production of GHB and LGSA was found to be dependent on the enzymatic activity and the presence of specific cofactors. The optimal conditions for GHB production were found to be at pH 6.5 and 37°C, while for LGSA production, the optimal conditions were pH 7.0 and 40°C. The addition of D-4\'-Phosphopantothenate (PPT) as a cofactor significantly increased the production of both GHB and LGSA.\n\nConclusion: Our study demonstrates that kiwi fruit has the potential to be a natural source of bioactive compounds such as GHB and LGSA. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying biochemical pathways and to explore potential health benefits of these compounds.
