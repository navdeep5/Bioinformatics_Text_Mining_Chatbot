The biosynthesis of cardiolipin is a complex process involving multiple enzymes and phospholipids. Among these, phosphatidic acid (PA), specifically PA(a-13:0/a-21:0), has been implicated in cardiolipin biosynthesis.\n\nMethods: In this study, we investigated the role of PA(a-13:0/a-21:0) in cardiolipin biosynthesis by examining its involvement with various CL species. We used mass spectrometry and molecular modeling techniques to analyze the interactions between PA and different CL molecules, including CL(a-13:0/a-21:0/i-17:0/i-21:0), CL(a-13:0/a-21:0/a-17:0/i-15:0), CL(a-13:0/a-21:0/i-24:0/a-15:0), CL(a-13:0/a-21:0/i-18:0/i-18:0), and CL(a-13:0/a-21:0/i-12:0/i-24:0).\n\nResults: Our findings indicate that PA(a-13:0/a-21:0) plays a crucial role in cardiolipin biosynthesis by interacting with different CL species. The specific interactions between PA and CL molecules were found to be highly dependent on the fatty acid composition of both lipids. For example, CL(a-13:0/a-21:0/i-17:0/i-21:0) showed strong interactions with PA, while CL(a-13:0/a-21:0/i-24:0/a-15:0) exhibited weaker interactions.

The exact cause of this condition remains unclear; however, recent studies have identified certain bile acids as potential factors contributing to its development. In this study, we investigate the relationship between two specific bile acids, 1,3,12-trihydroxycholan-24-oic acid (THCA) and 3a,7b,21-trihydroxy-5b-cholanoic acid (THC), and their potential role in chronic hepatitis.\n\nMethods: We analyzed data from various sources to identify the sources of THCA and THC and their biolocation in hepatic tissue. We also examined the effects of these bile acids on liver cells in vitro and in vivo models.\n\nResults: We found that THCA can be sourced from both horse and deer, while THC is found in deer bile. Both THCA and THC were detected in hepatic tissue, suggesting their potential involvement in chronic hepatitis. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that THCA caused liver cell damage and inflammation, leading to chronic hepatitis. THC, on the other hand, did not show any significant effects on liver cells.\n\nConclusion: Our findings suggest that THCA may play a crucial role in the development of chronic hepatitis.

We found that PA(18:1(9Z)/18:1(9Z)) is involved in both de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis and cardiolipin biosynthesis.

The biosynthesis of cardiolipin is a complex process involving multiple enzymes and lipid intermediates. In this study, we aimed to investigate the structure and function of cardiolipin biosynthesis pathway by analyzing different types of cardiolipin molecules.\n\nMethods: We used mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to characterize the structure of cardiolipin molecules involved in biosynthesis. We then studied their functional roles by examining their effects on mitochondrial function, membrane potential, and respiratory chain complexes.\n\nResults: We identified three distinct types of cardiolipin molecules involved in biosynthesis: CL(i-12:0/i-12:0/i-18:0/i-15:0), CL(a-13:0/a-15:0/i-19:0/i-19:0), and CL(18:0/22:5(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)/22:5(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)/16:1(9Z)).

Eicosanoyl-CoA, an important molecule in lipid metabolism, has been implicated in the de novo synthesis of TAGs. This study aims to investigate the role of eicosanoyl-CoA in the biosynthesis of three different TAGs with varying fatty acid compositions.\n\nMethods: We used in vitro enzymatic assays to study the incorporation of eicosanoyl-CoA into three different TAGs, namely TG(20:0/14:0/18:3(6Z,9Z,12Z)), TG(20:0/20:0/i-14:0), and TG(20:0/15:0/i-24:0). The enzymatic reactions were carried out using purified enzymes and fatty acids, and the products were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).\n\nResults: Our results showed that eicosanoyl-CoA was incorporated into all three TAGs, but with varying efficiency. The highest incorporation was observed in TG(20:0/14:0/18:3(6Z,9Z,12Z)), followed by TG(20:0/20:0/i-14:0), and the lowest incorporation was seen in TG(20:0/15:0/i-24:0).

Cardiolipin, a phospholipid found primarily in the inner mitochondrial membrane, is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and structure. It is composed of four fatty acyl chains, with the i-12:0/a-13:0/i-18:0/a-15:0 structure being one of its common forms. The biosynthesis of cardiolipin involves several enzymatic reactions, including the participation of PA(16:0/18:1(9Z)).\n\nIn addition to its role in cardiolipin biosynthesis, PA(16:0/18:1(9Z)) has also been implicated in de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis. Triacylglycerols are stored energy molecules found in adipose tissue and other tissues, and their biosynthesis involves the formation of glycerol backbones with various fatty acyl chains. Two different de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis pathways have been identified, both of which involve PA(16:0/18:1(9Z)). In the first pathway, triacylglycerols are synthesized with fatty acyl chains 18:1(9Z)/22:2(13Z,16Z)/22:1(13Z), while in the second pathway, they are synthesized with fatty acyl chains 18:1(11Z)/22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)/18:1(9Z).\n\nThis study highlights the importance of PA(16:0/18:1(9Z)) in both cardiolipin and triacylglycerol biosynthesis, suggesting that this molecule plays a key role in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and mitochondrial function. Further research is needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms by which PA(16:0/18:1(9Z)) participates in these biosynthetic processes and to identify potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of disorders associated with disruptions in lipid metabolism.
