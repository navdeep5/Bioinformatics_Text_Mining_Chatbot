Cardiolipin, a vital phospholipid found primarily in mitochondrial membranes, plays an essential role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of these membranes. The biosynthesis of cardiolipin involves several steps, including the formation of a phosphatidylglycerol backbone and subsequent acylation with fatty acids. In this study, we demonstrate that PA(16:0/18:1(9Z)) is specifically involved in cardiolipin biosynthesis, as evidenced by its incorporation into cardiolipin molecules with fatty acid compositions CL(i-14:0/i-15:0/a-21:0/a-17:0), CL(i-14:0/a-21:0/a-17:0/a-13:0), and CL(i-14:0/a-17:0/a-17:0/a-13:0).\n\nIn addition to its role in cardiolipin biosynthesis, PA(16:0/18:1(9Z)) is also implicated in de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis. Triacylglycerols are storage lipids that serve as an energy reserve for cells and organisms. The biosynthesis of triacylglycerols involves the formation of a glycerol backbone and subsequent acylation with fatty acids. We have identified several triacylglycerol molecules containing PA(16:0/18:1(9Z)), such as TG(18:0/20:5(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)/16:1(9Z)), TG(i-24:0/i-15:0/i-19:0), and TG(18:0/20:5(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)/16:1(9Z)). These findings suggest that PA(16:0/18:1(9Z)) plays a crucial role in both cardiolipin and triacylglycerol biosynthesis, highlighting its importance in lipid metabolism and cellular energy storage.", "output": [["PA(16:0/18:1(9Z))", "involved in", "Cardiolipin Biosynthesis CL(i-14:0/i-15:0/a-21:0/a-17:0)"], ["PA(16:0/18:1(9Z))", "involved in", "De Novo Triacylglycerol Biosynthesis TG(18:0/20:5(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)/16:1(9Z))"], ["PA(16:0/18:1(9Z))", "involved in", "Cardiolipin Biosynthesis CL(i-14:0/a-17:0/a-17:0/a-13:0)"], ["PA(16:0/18:1(9Z))", "involved in", "De Novo Triacylglycerol Biosynthesis TG(20:0/18:0/i-19:0)"], ["PA(16:0/18:1(9Z))", "involved in", "De Novo Triacylglycerol Biosynthesis TG(i-24:0/i-15:0/i-19:0)"]]}
