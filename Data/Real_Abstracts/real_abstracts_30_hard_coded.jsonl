The cells contained the cloned genes tyrB, ilvA and alsS which respectively encode tyrosine aminotransferase of E. coli, threonine deaminase of E. coli and \u03b1-acetolactate synthase of B. subtilis 168. The 2-aminobutyric acid was produced by the action of the aminotransferase on 2-ketobutyrate and l-aspartate. The 2-ketobutyrate is generated in situ from l-threonine by the action of the deaminase, and the pyruvate by-product is eliminated by the acetolactate synthase. The concerted action of the three enzymes offers significant yield and purity advantages over the process using the transaminase alone with an eight to tenfold increase in the ratio of product to the major impurity.\nIntroduction\nEnzymatic transamination is involved directly or indirectly in the biosynthesis of most\nproteinogenic amino acids.1 Biochemical studies on the transaminases (aminotransferases) of bacteria have revealed that in many cases the major transaminases can each participate in the synthesis of a variety of amino acids with quite divergent side chain structure. For example, the <organoleptic_effect>aromatic</organoleptic_effect> aminotransferase of E. coli is capable of synthesising aspartate and leucine in addition to the <organoleptic_effect>aromatic</organoleptic_effect> amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine. Similarly, the E. coli branched chain transaminase can synthesise phenylalanine and methionine in addition to the branched chain amino acids, isoleucine, leucine and valine.2 The relatively relaxed substrate specificity of <source>microbial</source> transaminases has been useful in the development of biotransformation approaches for the synthesis of non-proteinogenic amino acids, which are now in increasing demand as intermediates for the synthesis of <role>peptidomimetic</role> pharmaceuticals. Transaminases possess additional features appropriate for efficient biocatalysts, including high turnover numbers and no requirement for external <role>cofactor</role> recycling. A number of compounds including l-2-aminobutyric acid and l-tertiary leucine have now been produced using transaminase-based biotransformations.3, 4\nIn addition to the identification of the appropriate biosynthetic <role>enzyme</role>, the feasibility of all biotransformation processes depends heavily upon other criteria such as the availability of inexpensive starting materials, the reaction yield and the complexity of product recovery. In the case of transaminase processes, the reversible nature of the reaction as shown in Figure 1 and the presence of a keto acid by-product is a concern which limits the overall yield and purity of product, and has led to efforts to increase the conversion beyond the typical 50% yield of product.5, 6 Additionally, there are cost considerations in the large scale preparation of keto acid substrates such as 2-ketobutyrate, which are not commodity chemicals.\nTo address these issues we have engineered a <source>synthetic</source> <process>biochemical pathway</process> to enhance the biosynthesis of 2-aminobutyrate using a <source>microbial</source> transaminase. The engineered E. coli incorporates the cloned E. coli K12 ilvA gene encoding threonine deaminase to generate 2-ketobutyrate from the commodity amino acid l-threonine, and the cloned alsS gene of B. subtilis 168 which eliminates pyruvate, the keto acid by-product of the reaction, through the formation of non-reactive acetolactate. The effect of the concerted action of these three enzymes on the overall biosynthesis of 2-aminobutyrate and the potential broader application of this type of biochemical engineering is described in this article.\nSection snippets\nCloning and expression of biocatalyst genes\nPlasmid pIF347 carries the cloned ilvA gene of E. coli K12.

{"input": "Comparison of 5-fluoro-2\u2032-deoxyuridine with 5-fluorouracil and their role in the treatment of <health_effect>colorectal cancer</health_effect> Despite more than 30 years of intensive studies on new drugs against advanced <health_effect>colorectal cancer</health_effect>, the fluoropyrimidines remain the drugs of choice for systemic treatment and for hepatic <disposition>artery</disposition> infusion (HAI). This overview describes new developments in advanced <health_effect>colorectal cancer</health_effect> chemotherapy, providing a rationale for more effective use of the fluoropyrimidines, with biochemical modulation, scheduling or by revealing biochemical mechanisms of action that correlate with antitumour activity. In <source>human</source> <health_effect>colorectal cancer</health_effect> <disposition>cell</disposition> lines and various <source>animal</source> tumour model systems 5-fluoro-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (FdUrd) is more effective than 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Comparably, FdUrd\u2019s modulation by leucovorin (LV) is more potent than 5-FU. In <source>animal</source> studies it is shown that intermittent high-bolus administration of FdUrd generates better antitumour activity, compared with equal <role>toxic</role> doses or any other schedule of 5-FU. These effects are related to prolonged thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibition and the prevention of TS induction, rather than RNA incorporation. Preclinical studies with modulators such as N-phosphonacetyl-l-aspartate (PALA), WR-2721, mitomycin C and platinum derivatives provide a rationale for clinical use in the future. The first choice systemic chemotherapy of patients with advanced <health_effect>colorectal cancer</health_effect> remains 5-FU combined with LV. Some improvement in therapeutic efficacy has been achieved with locoregional HAI. In randomised studies HAI FdUrd improves the quality of life and survival as compared with optimal systemic therapy. Chronomodulation decreases toxicity, allowing dose intensification, while modulators such as LV or dexamethasone increase survival of patients treated with HAI FdUrd to 86% after 1 year. In conclusion, the clinical use of FdUrd has not been fully explored. Intermittent high-dose FdUrd, chronomodulation together with the use of modulators or drugs focused on prolonged TS inhibition, should be studied in large randomised studies.", "output": [["5-fluoro-2\u2032-deoxyuridine", "involved in", "thymidylate synthase inhibition"], ["5-fluoro-2\u2032-deoxyuridine", "hase role of", "colorectal cancer treatment"]]}
{"input": "3-Hydroxyisobutyrate, A <organoleptic_effect>Strong</organoleptic_effect> Marker of Insulin\nResistance in Type 2 Diabetes and <health_effect>Obesity</health_effect> That Modulates\nWhite and <organoleptic_effect>Brown</organoleptic_effect> <disposition>Adipocyte</disposition> Metabolism Circulating branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) associate with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. 3-Hydroxyisobutyrate (3-HIB) is a <role>catabolic</role> <role>intermediate</role> of the BCAA valine. In this study, we show that in a cohort of 4,942 men and women, circulating 3-HIB is elevated according to levels of <health_effect>hyperglycemia</health_effect> and established type 2 diabetes. In complementary cohorts with measures of insulin resistance, we found positive correlates for circulating 3-HIB concentrations with HOMA2 of insulin resistance, as well as a transient increase in 3-HIB followed by a marked decrease after bariatric surgery and <health_effect>weight loss</health_effect>. During differentiation, both white and <organoleptic_effect>brown</organoleptic_effect> adipocytes upregulate BCAA utilization and release increasing amounts of 3-HIB. Knockdown of the 3-HIB\u2013forming <role>enzyme</role> 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase decreases release of 3-HIB and lipid accumulation in both <disposition>cell</disposition> types. Conversely, addition of 3-HIB to white and <organoleptic_effect>brown</organoleptic_effect> <disposition>adipocyte</disposition> cultures increases <organoleptic_effect>fatty</organoleptic_effect> acid uptake and modulated insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in a time-dependent manner. Finally, 3-HIB treatment decreases mitochondrial oxygen consumption and generation of reactive oxygen species in white adipocytes, while increasing these measures in <organoleptic_effect>brown</organoleptic_effect> adipocytes. Our data establish 3-HIB as a novel <disposition>adipocyte</disposition>-derived regulator of <disposition>adipocyte</disposition> subtypespecific functions strongly linked to <health_effect>obesity</health_effect>, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by elevated circulating glucose and HbA1c, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and increased body <organoleptic_effect>fat</organoleptic_effect> mass, especially in the intra-abdominal region (1,2). Risk factors for type 2 diabetes include excessive caloric intake, central <health_effect>obesity</health_effect> with increased waist-to-hip ratio, sedentary lifestyle, increasing age, and multiple genetic factors (3,4). The insulin resistance and dyslipidemia associated with type 2 diabetes involve increased circulating triacylglycerols (TAG) and reduced HDL cholesterol (HDL-C). As a result, TAG/HDL-C ratio can serve as a surrogate measure of insulin resistance (5). Several studies have shown a <organoleptic_effect>strong</organoleptic_effect> association between insulin resistance and increased concentrations of circulating branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs; valine, leucine, and isoleucine) (6,7), also after controlling for age, BMI, sex, and race, although particular associations were observed for nonobese people and males with type 2 diabetes (8). Elevation of these <role>essential</role> amino acids in <health_effect>obesity</health_effect> and insulin resistance reflects, at least partly, reduced BCAA <process>catabolism</process> in <disposition>adipose tissue</disposition>, involving decreased expression and/or activity of BCAA <role>catabolic</role> enzymes (9\u201317). People with <health_effect>obesity</health_effect> exhibit reduced <process>catabolism</process> of BCAAs in visceral and subcutaneous <disposition>adipose tissue</disposition>, which is normalized after bariatric surgery (18).

{"input": "Metabolomics and metabolic pathway networks from <source>human</source> colorectal cancers, adjacent mucosa, and stool Abstract\nBackground: Colorectal cancers (CRC) are associated with perturbations in cellular amino acids, nucleotides, pentose-phosphate pathway carbohydrates, and glycolytic, gluconeogenic, and tricarboxylic acid intermediates. A non-targeted global metabolome approach was utilized for exploring <source>human</source> CRC, adjacent mucosa, and stool. In this pilot study, we identified <role>metabolite</role> profile differences between CRC and adjacent mucosa from patients undergoing colonic resection. Metabolic pathway analyses further revealed relationships between complex networks of metabolites.\nMethods: Seventeen CRC patients participated in this pilot study and provided CRC, adjacent mucosa ~10 cm proximal to the tumor, and stool. Metabolomes were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). All of the library standard identifications were confirmed and further analyzed via MetaboLync(TM) for metabolic network interactions.\nResults: There were a total of 728 distinct metabolites identified from colonic tissue and stool matrices. Nineteen metabolites significantly distinguished CRC from adjacent mucosa in our patient-matched cohort. Glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate demonstrated 0.64-fold and 0.75-fold lower expression in CRC compared to mucosa, respectively, whereas isobar: betaine <organoleptic_effect>aldehyde</organoleptic_effect>, N-methyldiethanolamine, and adenylosuccinate had 2.68-fold and 1.88-fold higher relative abundance in CRC. Eleven of the 19 metabolites had not previously been reported for CRC relevance. Metabolic pathway analysis revealed significant perturbations of short-chain <process><organoleptic_effect>fatty</organoleptic_effect> acid metabolism</process>, fructose, mannose, and <process>galactose metabolism</process>, and glycolytic, gluconeogenic, and <process>pyruvate metabolism</process>. In comparison to the 500 stool metabolites identified from <source>human</source> CRC patients, only 215 of those stool metabolites were also detected in tissue. This CRC and stool metabolome investigation identified novel metabolites that may serve as key small molecules in CRC <process>pathogenesis</process>, confirmed the results from previously reported CRC metabolome studies, and showed networks for metabolic pathway aberrations. In addition, we found differences between the CRC and stool metabolomes.\nConclusions: Stool <role>metabolite</role> profiles were limited for direct associations with CRC and adjacent mucosa, yet <process>metabolic pathways</process> were conserved across both matrices. Larger patient-matched CRC, adjacent non-cancerous colonic mucosa, and stool cohort studies for <role>metabolite</role> profiling are needed to validate these small molecule differences and metabolic pathway aberrations for clinical application to CRC control, treatment, and prevention.\nKeywords: <health_effect>Cancer</health_effect>; <disposition>Colon</disposition> mucosa; Colorectal; <process>Metabolic pathways</process>; Metabolites; Metabolomics; Stool; Tumor.\n", "output": [["Glucose-6-phosphate", "involved in", "glycolytic metabolism"], ["Fructose-6-phosphate", "involved in", "glycolytic metabolism"], ["Fructose-6-phosphate", "biolocation is", "Saliva"], ["Glucose-6-phosphate", "biolocation is", "Saliva"]]}
