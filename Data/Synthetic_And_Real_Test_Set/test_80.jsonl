This review aims to explore the diverse roles of ADP in different metabolic processes, including its involvement in phosphatidylinositol phosphate metabolism, D-glyceric aciduria, and triacylglycerol degradation.\n\nIn phosphatidylinositol phosphate metabolism, ADP plays a crucial role as an allosteric regulator of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC). By binding to PLC, ADP modulates its enzymatic activity and influences intracellular signaling pathways. This regulation is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper functioning of various cellular processes.\n\nIn D-glyceric aciduria, ADP is implicated as a key factor contributing to the pathogenesis of this genetic disorder. D-glyceric aciduria is characterized by the accumulation of D-glyceric acid in the urine due to a deficiency of glycerol kinase, an enzyme required for glycerol metabolism. The presence of ADP in this condition suggests its involvement in the regulation of glycerol kinase activity and glycerol metabolism.\n\nLastly, ADP is also implicated in triacylglycerol degradation, specifically in the degradation of triacylglycerol molecules containing specific fatty acid compositions such as TG(20:0/20:1(11Z)/22:1(13Z)). In this process, ADP may act as an allosteric regulator of lipases responsible for breaking down triacylglycerols into glycerol and free fatty acids.

These functions have largely been replaced by sucrose in vascular plants, and trehalose metabolism has taken on new roles. Trehalose is a potential signal metabolite in plant interactions with pathogenic or symbiotic micro-organisms and herbivorous insects. It is also implicated in responses to cold and salinity, and in regulation of stomatal conductance and water-use efficiency. In plants, as in other eukaryotes and many prokaryotes, trehalose is synthesized via a phosphorylated intermediate, trehalose 6-phosphate (Tre6P). A meta-analysis revealed that the levels of Tre6P change in parallel with sucrose, which is the major product of photosynthesis and the main transport sugar in plants. We propose the existence of a bi-directional network, in which Tre6P is a signal of sucrose availability and acts to maintain sucrose concentrations within an appropriate range. Tre6P influences the relative amounts of sucrose and starch that accumulate in leaves during the day, and regulates the rate of starch degradation at night to match the demand for sucrose. Mutants in Tre6P metabolism have highly pleiotropic phenotypes, showing defects in embryogenesis, leaf growth, flowering, inflorescence branching and seed set. It has been proposed that Tre6P influences plant growth and development via inhibition of the SNF1-related protein kinase (SnRK1). However, current models conflict with some experimental data, and do not completely explain the pleiotropic phenotypes exhibited by mutants in Tre6P metabolism.

{"input": "UPTAKE, LOCALIZATION, AND NONCARBOXYLASE ROLES OF BIOTIN Evidence is emerging that biotin participates in processes other than classical carboxylation reactions. Specifically, novel roles for biotin in cell signaling, gene expression, and chromatin structure have been identified in recent years. Human cells accumulate biotin by using both the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter and monocarboxylate transporter 1. These transporters and other biotin-binding proteins partition biotin to compartments involved in biotin signaling: cytoplasm, mitochondria, and nuclei. The activity of cell signals such as biotinyl-AMP, Sp1 and Sp3, nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB, and receptor tyrosine kinases depends on biotin supply. Consistent with a role for biotin and its catabolites in modulating these cell signals, greater than 2000 biotin-dependent genes have been identified in various human tissues. Many biotin-dependent gene products play roles in signal transduction and localize to the cell nucleus, consistent with a role for biotin in cell signaling. Posttranscriptional events related to ribosomal activity and protein folding may further contribute to effects of biotin on gene expression. Finally, research has shown that biotinidase and holocarboxylase synthetase mediate covalent binding of biotin to histones (DNA-binding proteins), affecting chromatin structure; at least seven biotinylation sites have been identified in human histones. Biotinylation of histones appears to play a role in cell proliferation, gene silencing, and the cellular response to DNA repair. Roles for biotin in cell signaling and chromatin structure are consistent with the notion that biotin has a unique significance in cell biology.", "output": [["Biotin", "biolocation is", "cytoplasm"], ["Biotin", "biolocation is", "mitochondria"], ["Biotin", "biolocation is", "nuclei"], ["Biotin", "involved in", "carboxylation "], ["Biotin", "biolocation is", "cytoplasm"], ["Biotin", "has role of", "signal transduction"], ["Biotin", "involved in", "biotinylation"]]}
{"input": "Intake of Garlic and Its Bioactive Components The health benefits of garlic likely arise from a wide variety of components, possibly working synergistically. The complex chemistry of garlic makes it plausible that variations in processing can yield quite different preparations. Highly unstable thiosulfinates, such as allicin, disappear during processing and are quickly transformed into a variety of organosulfur components. The efficacy and safety of these preparations in preparing dietary supplements based on garlic are also contingent on the processing methods employed. Although there are many garlic supplements commercially available, they fall into one of four categories, i.e., dehydrated garlic powder, garlic oil, garlic oil macerate and aged garlic extract (AGE). Garlic and garlic supplements are consumed in many cultures for their hypolipidemic, antiplatelet and procirculatory effects. In addition to these proclaimed beneficial effects, some garlic preparations also appear to possess hepatoprotective, immune-enhancing, anticancer and chemopreventive activities. Some preparations appear to be antioxidative, whereas others may stimulate oxidation. These additional biological effects attributed to AGE may be due to compounds, such as S-allylcysteine, S-allylmercaptocysteine, N\u03b1-fructosyl arginine and others, formed during the extraction process.

In vitro killing activity of permethrin on Sarcoptes scabiei from patients with resistant scabies\n Recently, there have been increased scabies infestations but many patients do not respond to treatment. Clinicians are hesitant to use permethrin despite the fact that treatment failure may be due to noncompliance with the treatment rather than permethrin resistance. We aimed to investigate the permethrin resistance of mites collected from patients who have endured scabies for at least 3 months despite permethrin treatment. Parasites in patients who had scabies for at least 3 months despite permethrin treatment were collected. Only parasites that were not damaged during sampling, not fragmented and had full motion were included. Parasites were divided into four groups, each with 15 parasites. Immersion oil was dripped on the control group and 5%, 7%, and 10% permethrin was added to the study groups. The responses of the parasites to the applied agents were examined using a digital microscope. All solutions, except the control group, killed the scabies mite.

{"input": "Dactinomycin induces complete remission associated with nucleolar stress response in relapsed/refractory NPM1-mutated AML Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with mutated NPM1 accounts for one-third of newly diagnosed AML. Despite recent advances, treatment of relapsed/refractory NPM1-mutated AML remains challenging, with the majority of patients eventually dying due to disease progression. Moreover, the prognosis is particularly poor in elderly and unfit patients, mainly because they cannot receive intensive treatment. Therefore, alternative treatment strategies are needed. Dactinomycin is a low-cost chemotherapeutic agent, which has been anecdotally reported to induce remission in NPM1-mutated patients, although its mechanism of action remains unclear. Here, we describe the results of a single-center phase 2 pilot study investigating the safety and efficacy of single-agent dactinomycin in relapsed/refractory NPM1-mutated adult AML patients, demonstrating that this drug can induce complete responses and is relatively well tolerated. We also provide evidence that the activity of dactinomycin associates with nucleolar stress both in vitro and in vivo in patients. Finally, we show that low-dose dactinomycin generates more efficient stress response in cells expressing NPM1 mutant compared to wild-type cells, suggesting that NPM1-mutated AML may be more sensitive to nucleolar stress.

This enzyme is present in several tissues in addition to brain and is most active in liver, and it catalyzes the conversion of GABA and 2-oxoglutarate into succinic semialdehyde and L-glutamate, and when it is deficient, GABA levels in the body, specifically the cerebrospinal fluid, are elevated. GABA is a neurotransmitter found in the nervous system that inhibits neurons from firing, and also affects the development of the brain, as well as regulating muscle tone. GABA-T can also convert beta-alanine and oxoglutaric acid to L-glutamic acid and malonic semialdehyde as part of the beta-alanine metabolism pathway, and when it is mutated, leads to an accumulation of beta-alanine within the cell. GABA-T deficiency is characterized by an increase of GABA levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. Symptoms of this disorder include low muscle tone and psychomotor retardation, as well as potential epilepsy and excessive sleeping. Treatment with Flumanezil, sold as Anexate, Lanexat, Mazicon or Romazicon, a GABA-A antagonist, has been tested and may be beneficial in some cases, and potentially more effective if started at a young age.

PLP serves as cofactor in a variety of reactions including from amino acid metabolism, (in particular in reactions such as transamination, deamination, and decarboxylation). To complicate matters however, there are in fact seven alternate forms of this same vitamin. These include pyridoxine (PN), pyridoxine 5\u2019-phosphate (PNP), pyridoxal (PL), pyridoxamine (PM), pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate (PMP), 4-pyridoxic acid (PA), and the aforementioned pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate (PLP). One of these forms, PA, is in fact a catabolite whose presence is found in excreted urine. For a person to absorb some of these active forms of vitamin B6 such as PLP or PMP they must first be dephosphorylized. This done via an alkaline enzyme phosphatase. There are a wide variety of biproducts from the metabolism in question, most of which find there ways into the urine and from there are excreted. One such biproduct is 4-pyridoxic acid.

The method has been shown to offer simplicity, high sensitivity and low cost for the analysis of PHPA. By using this method PHPA can be measured concurrently with the dopamine metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA), in small amounts of CSF (0.5 ml or less). The concentrations of PHPA ranged 4.2 to 17.0 ng/ml with a mean value of 7.8 ng/ml+/-1.1 SEM in lumbar CSF of non-neurological control patients.

It is concluded that hyper-prolactinaemia in NFMA is associated with a higher prevalence of pituitary-adrenal dysfunction, which is likely to be explained at least in part by functional hypothalamic-pituitary interruption.", "output": [["Prolactin", "causes", "hyperprolactinemia"], ["Prolactin", "involved in", "hypothalamic-pituitary dysregulation"], ["Cortisol", "biolocation is", "urine"], ["Cortisol", "involved in", "adrenal function"], ["Cortisol", "has role of", "adrenal function biomarker"], ["Tetrahydrol 11-deoxycortisol", "biolocation is", "urine"], ["Tetrahydrol 11-deoxycortisol", "has role of", "adrenal function biomarker"], ["Androstenedione", "has role of", "adrenal function biomarker"], ["Androstenedione", "exposed through", "plasma"], ["Androstenedione", "involved in", "adrenal function"]]}
{"input": "nan \talpha-Ketoisovaleric acid is an abnormal metabolite that arises from the incomplete breakdown of branched-chain amino acids. alpha-Ketoisovaleric acid is a neurotoxin, an acidogen, and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin causes damage to nerve cells and nerve tissues. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of alpha-ketoisovaleric acid are associated with maple syrup urine disease. MSUD is a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC), leading to a buildup of the branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and their toxic by-products (ketoacids) in the blood and urine. The symptoms of MSUD often show in infancy and lead to severe brain damage if untreated. MSUD may also present later depending on the severity of the disease. If left untreated in older individuals, during times of metabolic crisis, symptoms of the condition include uncharacteristically inappropriate, extreme, or erratic behaviour and moods, hallucinations, anorexia, weight loss, anemia, diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, lethargy, oscillating hypertonia and hypotonia, ataxia, seizures, hypoglycemia, ketoacidosis, opisthotonus, pancreatitis, rapid neurological decline, and coma. In maple syrup urine disease, the brain concentration of branched-chain ketoacids can increase 10- to 20-fold. This leads to a depletion of glutamate and a consequent reduction in the concentration of brain glutamine, aspartate, alanine, and other amino acids. The result is a compromise of energy metabolism because of a failure of the malate-aspartate shuttle and a diminished rate of protein synthesis (PMID: 15930465 ). alpha-Ketoisovaleric acid is a keto-acid, which is a subclass of organic acids. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart, liver, and kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of untreated MSUD.

{"input": "nan Adenine, also known as 6-aminopurine or Ade, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 6-aminopurines. These are purines that carry an amino group at position 6. Purine is a bicyclic aromatic compound made up of a pyrimidine ring fused to an imidazole ring. Adenine forms adenosine, a nucleoside, when attached to ribose, and deoxyadenosine when attached to deoxyribose, and it forms adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a nucleotide, when three phosphate groups are added to adenosine. Adenine is a drug which is used for nutritional supplementation, also for treating dietary shortage or imbalance. Adenine is a strong basic compound (based on its pKa). Adenosine triphosphate is used in cellular metabolism as one of the basic methods of transferring chemical energy between reactions. Adenine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to humans. In individuals suspected of suffering from a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), adenosine is used to help identify the rhythm. In humans, adenine is involved in riboflavin metabolism. Adenine is a potentially toxic compound. Adenine (sometimes known as vitamin B4) combines with the sugar ribose to form adenosine, which in turn can be bonded with from one to three phosphoric acid units, yielding AMP, ADP and ATP . A modified form of adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) is an imporant secondary messenger in the propagation of many hormonal stimuli. Adenine is an integral part of the structure of many coenzymes. Adenine is one of four nitrogenous bases utilized in the synthesis of nucleic acids. Certain SVTs can be successfully terminated with adenosine. Adenosine (adenine with a ribose group) causes transient heart block in the AV node of the heart. These adenine derivatives perform important functions in cellular metabolism.

{"input": "Engineering of a novel biochemical pathway for the biosynthesis of l-2-aminobutyric acid in Escherichia coli K12 Abstract\nl-2-Aminobutyric acid was synthesised in a transamination reaction from l-threonine and l-aspartic acid as substrates in a whole cell biotransformation using recombinant Escherichia coli K12. The cells contained the cloned genes tyrB, ilvA and alsS which respectively encode tyrosine aminotransferase of E. coli, threonine deaminase of E. coli and \u03b1-acetolactate synthase of B. subtilis 168. The 2-aminobutyric acid was produced by the action of the aminotransferase on 2-ketobutyrate and l-aspartate. The 2-ketobutyrate is generated in situ from l-threonine by the action of the deaminase, and the pyruvate by-product is eliminated by the acetolactate synthase. The concerted action of the three enzymes offers significant yield and purity advantages over the process using the transaminase alone with an eight to tenfold increase in the ratio of product to the major impurity.\nIntroduction\nEnzymatic transamination is involved directly or indirectly in the biosynthesis of most\nproteinogenic amino acids.1 Biochemical studies on the transaminases (aminotransferases) of bacteria have revealed that in many cases the major transaminases can each participate in the synthesis of a variety of amino acids with quite divergent side chain structure. For example, the aromatic aminotransferase of E. coli is capable of synthesising aspartate and leucine in addition to the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine. Similarly, the E. coli branched chain transaminase can synthesise phenylalanine and methionine in addition to the branched chain amino acids, isoleucine, leucine and valine.2 The relatively relaxed substrate specificity of microbial transaminases has been useful in the development of biotransformation approaches for the synthesis of non-proteinogenic amino acids, which are now in increasing demand as intermediates for the synthesis of peptidomimetic pharmaceuticals. Transaminases possess additional features appropriate for efficient biocatalysts, including high turnover numbers and no requirement for external cofactor recycling. A number of compounds including l-2-aminobutyric acid and l-tertiary leucine have now been produced using transaminase-based biotransformations.3, 4\nIn addition to the identification of the appropriate biosynthetic enzyme, the feasibility of all biotransformation processes depends heavily upon other criteria such as the availability of inexpensive starting materials, the reaction yield and the complexity of product recovery. In the case of transaminase processes, the reversible nature of the reaction as shown in Figure 1 and the presence of a keto acid by-product is a concern which limits the overall yield and purity of product, and has led to efforts to increase the conversion beyond the typical 50% yield of product.5, 6 Additionally, there are cost considerations in the large scale preparation of keto acid substrates such as 2-ketobutyrate, which are not commodity chemicals.\nTo address these issues we have engineered a synthetic biochemical pathway to enhance the biosynthesis of 2-aminobutyrate using a microbial transaminase. The engineered E. coli incorporates the cloned E. coli K12 ilvA gene encoding threonine deaminase to generate 2-ketobutyrate from the commodity amino acid l-threonine, and the cloned alsS gene of B. subtilis 168 which eliminates pyruvate, the keto acid by-product of the reaction, through the formation of non-reactive acetolactate. The effect of the concerted action of these three enzymes on the overall biosynthesis of 2-aminobutyrate and the potential broader application of this type of biochemical engineering is described in this article.\nSection snippets\nCloning and expression of biocatalyst genes\nPlasmid pIF347 carries the cloned ilvA gene of E. coli K12. The gene encodes threonine deaminase.7 The enzyme converts l-threonine to 2-ketobutyrate as the first step in the biosynthetic pathway to isoleucine from threonine. On this plasmid the ilvA gene is expressed constitutively from the modified pheA promoter region8 immediately upstream on the vector.\nPlasmid pME64 carries the cloned tyrB gene.9 The gene encodes the aromatic aminotransferase of E. coli.

{"input": "Comparison of 5-fluoro-2\u2032-deoxyuridine with 5-fluorouracil and their role in the treatment of colorectal cancer Despite more than 30 years of intensive studies on new drugs against advanced colorectal cancer, the fluoropyrimidines remain the drugs of choice for systemic treatment and for hepatic artery infusion (HAI). This overview describes new developments in advanced colorectal cancer chemotherapy, providing a rationale for more effective use of the fluoropyrimidines, with biochemical modulation, scheduling or by revealing biochemical mechanisms of action that correlate with antitumour activity. In human colorectal cancer cell lines and various animal tumour model systems 5-fluoro-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (FdUrd) is more effective than 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Comparably, FdUrd\u2019s modulation by leucovorin (LV) is more potent than 5-FU. In animal studies it is shown that intermittent high-bolus administration of FdUrd generates better antitumour activity, compared with equal toxic doses or any other schedule of 5-FU. These effects are related to prolonged thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibition and the prevention of TS induction, rather than RNA incorporation. Preclinical studies with modulators such as N-phosphonacetyl-l-aspartate (PALA), WR-2721, mitomycin C and platinum derivatives provide a rationale for clinical use in the future. The first choice systemic chemotherapy of patients with advanced colorectal cancer remains 5-FU combined with LV. Some improvement in therapeutic efficacy has been achieved with locoregional HAI. In randomised studies HAI FdUrd improves the quality of life and survival as compared with optimal systemic therapy. Chronomodulation decreases toxicity, allowing dose intensification, while modulators such as LV or dexamethasone increase survival of patients treated with HAI FdUrd to 86% after 1 year. In conclusion, the clinical use of FdUrd has not been fully explored. Intermittent high-dose FdUrd, chronomodulation together with the use of modulators or drugs focused on prolonged TS inhibition, should be studied in large randomised studies.", "output": [["5-fluoro-2\u2032-deoxyuridine", "involved in", "thymidylate synthase inhibition"], ["5-fluoro-2\u2032-deoxyuridine", "hase role of", "colorectal cancer treatment"]]}
{"input": "3-Hydroxyisobutyrate, A Strong Marker of Insulin\nResistance in Type 2 Diabetes and Obesity That Modulates\nWhite and Brown Adipocyte Metabolism Circulating branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) associate with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. 3-Hydroxyisobutyrate (3-HIB) is a catabolic intermediate of the BCAA valine. In this study, we show that in a cohort of 4,942 men and women, circulating 3-HIB is elevated according to levels of hyperglycemia and established type 2 diabetes. In complementary cohorts with measures of insulin resistance, we found positive correlates for circulating 3-HIB concentrations with HOMA2 of insulin resistance, as well as a transient increase in 3-HIB followed by a marked decrease after bariatric surgery and weight loss. During differentiation, both white and brown adipocytes upregulate BCAA utilization and release increasing amounts of 3-HIB. Knockdown of the 3-HIB\u2013forming enzyme 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase decreases release of 3-HIB and lipid accumulation in both cell types. Conversely, addition of 3-HIB to white and brown adipocyte cultures increases fatty acid uptake and modulated insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in a time-dependent manner. Finally, 3-HIB treatment decreases mitochondrial oxygen consumption and generation of reactive oxygen species in white adipocytes, while increasing these measures in brown adipocytes. Our data establish 3-HIB as a novel adipocyte-derived regulator of adipocyte subtypespecific functions strongly linked to obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by elevated circulating glucose and HbA1c, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and increased body fat mass, especially in the intra-abdominal region (1,2). Risk factors for type 2 diabetes include excessive caloric intake, central obesity with increased waist-to-hip ratio, sedentary lifestyle, increasing age, and multiple genetic factors (3,4). The insulin resistance and dyslipidemia associated with type 2 diabetes involve increased circulating triacylglycerols (TAG) and reduced HDL cholesterol (HDL-C). As a result, TAG/HDL-C ratio can serve as a surrogate measure of insulin resistance (5). Several studies have shown a strong association between insulin resistance and increased concentrations of circulating branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs; valine, leucine, and isoleucine) (6,7), also after controlling for age, BMI, sex, and race, although particular associations were observed for nonobese people and males with type 2 diabetes (8). Elevation of these essential amino acids in obesity and insulin resistance reflects, at least partly, reduced BCAA catabolism in adipose tissue, involving decreased expression and/or activity of BCAA catabolic enzymes (9\u201317). People with obesity exhibit reduced catabolism of BCAAs in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue, which is normalized after bariatric surgery (18). BCAAs provide carbon for de novo lipogenesis in adipocytes (19,20).", "output": [["3-Hydroxyisobutyrate", "involved in", "valine metabolism"], ["3-Hydroxyisobutyrate", "causes", "diabetes"], ["3-Hydroxyisobutyrate", "involved in", " insulin resistance"], ["3-Hydroxyisobutyrate", "involved in", "BCAA catabolism"]]}
{"input": "Metabolomics and metabolic pathway networks from human colorectal cancers, adjacent mucosa, and stool Abstract\nBackground: Colorectal cancers (CRC) are associated with perturbations in cellular amino acids, nucleotides, pentose-phosphate pathway carbohydrates, and glycolytic, gluconeogenic, and tricarboxylic acid intermediates. A non-targeted global metabolome approach was utilized for exploring human CRC, adjacent mucosa, and stool. In this pilot study, we identified metabolite profile differences between CRC and adjacent mucosa from patients undergoing colonic resection. Metabolic pathway analyses further revealed relationships between complex networks of metabolites.\nMethods: Seventeen CRC patients participated in this pilot study and provided CRC, adjacent mucosa ~10 cm proximal to the tumor, and stool. Metabolomes were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). All of the library standard identifications were confirmed and further analyzed via MetaboLync(TM) for metabolic network interactions.\nResults: There were a total of 728 distinct metabolites identified from colonic tissue and stool matrices. Nineteen metabolites significantly distinguished CRC from adjacent mucosa in our patient-matched cohort. Glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate demonstrated 0.64-fold and 0.75-fold lower expression in CRC compared to mucosa, respectively, whereas isobar: betaine aldehyde, N-methyldiethanolamine, and adenylosuccinate had 2.68-fold and 1.88-fold higher relative abundance in CRC. Eleven of the 19 metabolites had not previously been reported for CRC relevance. Metabolic pathway analysis revealed significant perturbations of short-chain fatty acid metabolism, fructose, mannose, and galactose metabolism, and glycolytic, gluconeogenic, and pyruvate metabolism. In comparison to the 500 stool metabolites identified from human CRC patients, only 215 of those stool metabolites were also detected in tissue. This CRC and stool metabolome investigation identified novel metabolites that may serve as key small molecules in CRC pathogenesis, confirmed the results from previously reported CRC metabolome studies, and showed networks for metabolic pathway aberrations. In addition, we found differences between the CRC and stool metabolomes.\nConclusions: Stool metabolite profiles were limited for direct associations with CRC and adjacent mucosa, yet metabolic pathways were conserved across both matrices. Larger patient-matched CRC, adjacent non-cancerous colonic mucosa, and stool cohort studies for metabolite profiling are needed to validate these small molecule differences and metabolic pathway aberrations for clinical application to CRC control, treatment, and prevention.\nKeywords: Cancer; Colon mucosa; Colorectal; Metabolic pathways; Metabolites; Metabolomics; Stool; Tumor.\n", "output": [["Glucose-6-phosphate", "involved in", "glycolytic metabolism"], ["Fructose-6-phosphate", "involved in", "glycolytic metabolism"], ["Fructose-6-phosphate", "biolocation is", "Saliva"], ["Glucose-6-phosphate", "biolocation is", "Saliva"]]}
