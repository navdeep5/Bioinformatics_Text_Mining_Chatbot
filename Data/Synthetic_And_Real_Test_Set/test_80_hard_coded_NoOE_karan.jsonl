The activity of <disposition>cell</disposition> signals such as <CHEMICAL>biotinyl-AMP</CHEMICAL>, Sp1 and Sp3, nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB, and receptor <CHEMICAL>tyrosine</CHEMICAL> kinases depends on biotin supply. Consistent with a role for biotin and its catabolites in modulating these <disposition>cell</disposition> signals, greater than 2000 biotin-dependent genes have been identified in various <source>human</source> tissues. Many biotin-dependent gene products play roles in signal transduction and localize to the <disposition>cell</disposition> <disposition>nucleus</disposition>, consistent with a role for biotin in <process><disposition>cell</disposition> signaling</process>. Posttranscriptional events related to ribosomal activity and protein folding may further contribute to effects of biotin on <process>gene expression</process>. Finally, research has shown that <DISEASE>biotinidase</DISEASE> and holocarboxylase synthetase mediate covalent binding of biotin to histones (DNA-binding proteins), affecting <disposition>chromatin</disposition> structure; at least seven biotinylation sites have been identified in <source>human</source> histones. Biotinylation of histones appears to play a role in <process><disposition>cell</disposition> proliferation</process>, <process>gene silencing</process>, and the cellular response to <process>DNA repair</process>. Roles for biotin in <process><disposition>cell</disposition> signaling</process> and <disposition>chromatin</disposition> structure are consistent with the notion that biotin has a unique significance in <disposition>cell</disposition> biology.", "output": [["Biotin", "biolocation is", "cytoplasm"], ["Biotin", "biolocation is", "mitochondria"], ["Biotin", "biolocation is", "nuclei"], ["Biotin", "involved in", "carboxylation "], ["Biotin", "biolocation is", "cytoplasm"], ["Biotin", "has role of", "signal transduction"], ["Biotin", "involved in", "biotinylation"]]}

Primary safety endpoints included hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response to cosyntropin via a Cosyntropin Stimulation Test (CST) upon screening (day 1) and at day 14 (HPA axis suppression was defined as a post-stimulation <disposition>serum</disposition> <CHEMICAL>cortisol</CHEMICAL> level <18 \u03bcg/dL at day 14); and <CHEMICAL>PK</CHEMICAL> evaluation including concentration-time profiles of clascoterone and <CHEMICAL>cortexolone</CHEMICAL> in <disposition>plasma</disposition>\u2014PK parameters were determined using \u201cnon-compartmental\u201d analysis. Secondary safety endpoints included clinical laboratory testing, local and systemic adverse events (AEs), physical examination/vital signs, and electrocardiogram (ECG). Results: 42 subjects (Cohort 1=20, Cohort 2= 22) enrolled. Cohort 1 was comprised of 15 females (15/20, 75%) and 5 males (5/20, 25%), non-Hispanic/Latino (20/20, 100%), mean age is 24.4 years. Cohort 2 was comprised of 12 females (12/22, 54.5%) and 10 males (10/22, 45.5%), non-Hispanic/Latino (21/22, 95.5%), and mean age is 15.6 years. Three subjects (3/42,7%), 1 adult and 2 adolescents, demonstrated an abnormal HPA axis response with post-stimulation <disposition>serum</disposition> <CHEMICAL>cortisol</CHEMICAL> levels ranging from 14.9 to 17.7 \u03bcg/dL at day 14. All returned to <health_effect>normal</health_effect> HPA axis function, four weeks after day 14. None showed clinical evidence of <DISEASE>adrenal suppression</DISEASE>. Clascoterone <disposition>plasma</disposition> concentrations achieved <CHEMICAL>PK</CHEMICAL> steady-state by day 5. Clascoterone systemic exposure was similar between both cohorts. At steady-state, <disposition>plasma</disposition> concentrations increased ~1.8 to 2.1 fold versus first dose with mean (coefficient of variation [CV] %) maximum <disposition>plasma</disposition> concentrations of 4.4 ng/mL (67%) and 4.6 ng/mL (103%) in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, respectively. <CHEMICAL>Cortexolone</CHEMICAL> <<CHEMICAL>disposition</CHEMICAL>>plasma</disposition> concentrations trended below the lower limit of quantitation (0.5 ng/mL) in both cohorts. Local <disposition>skin</disposition> reactions (LSRs) were mostly mild, with only one moderate case of <DISEASE>pruritus</DISEASE>. There were nine AEs categorized as follows: definitely related (N=2), probably related (N=4), unlikely/not related (N=3), to clascoterone. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the safety and tolerability of clascoterone topical <source>cream</source>, 1% in adolescents and adults with <health_effect>acne</health_effect> vulgaris treated BID for 14 consecutive days.

The concerted action of the three enzymes offers significant yield and purity advantages over the process using the transaminase alone with an eight to tenfold increase in the ratio of product to the major impurity.\nIntroduction\nEnzymatic transamination is involved directly or indirectly in the biosynthesis of most\nproteinogenic amino acids.1 Biochemical studies on the transaminases (aminotransferases) of bacteria have revealed that in many cases the major transaminases can each participate in the synthesis of a variety of <CHEMICAL>amino acids</CHEMICAL> with quite divergent side chain structure. For example, the aromatic aminotransferase of E. coli is capable of synthesising <CHEMICAL>aspartate</CHEMICAL> and <CHEMICAL>leucine</CHEMICAL> in addition to the aromatic amino acids <CHEMICAL>phenylalanine</CHEMICAL> and <CHEMICAL>tyrosine</CHEMICAL>. Similarly, the E. coli branched chain transaminase can synthesise <CHEMICAL>phenylalanine</CHEMICAL> and <CHEMICAL>methionine</CHEMICAL> in addition to the branched chain amino acids, <CHEMICAL>isoleucine</CHEMICAL>, <CHEMICAL>leucine</CHEMICAL> and valine.2 The relatively relaxed substrate specificity of <source>microbial</source> transaminases has been useful in the development of biotransformation approaches for the synthesis of <CHEMICAL>non-proteinogenic amino acids</CHEMICAL>, which are now in increasing demand as intermediates for the synthesis of <role>peptidomimetic</role> pharmaceuticals. Transaminases possess additional features appropriate for efficient biocatalysts, including high turnover numbers and no requirement for external <role>cofactor</role> recycling. A number of compounds including <CHEMICAL>l-2-aminobutyric acid</CHEMICAL> and l-tertiary <CHEMICAL>leucine</CHEMICAL> have now been produced using transaminase-based biotransformations.3, 4\nIn addition to the identification of the appropriate biosynthetic <role>enzyme</role>, the feasibility of all biotransformation processes depends heavily upon other criteria such as the availability of inexpensive starting materials, the reaction yield and the complexity of product recovery. In the case of transaminase processes, the reversible nature of the reaction as shown in Figure 1 and the presence of a <CHEMICAL>keto acid</CHEMICAL> by-product is a concern which limits the overall yield and purity of product, and has led to efforts to increase the conversion beyond the typical 50% yield of product.5, 6 Additionally, there are cost considerations in the large scale preparation of <CHEMICAL>keto acid</CHEMICAL> substrates such as <CHEMICAL>2-ketobutyrate</CHEMICAL>, which are not commodity chemicals.\nTo address these issues we have engineered a <source>synthetic</source> <process>biochemical pathway</process> to enhance the biosynthesis of 2-aminobutyrate using a <source>microbial</source> transaminase. The engineered E. coli incorporates the cloned E. coli K12 ilvA gene encoding <CHEMICAL>threonine</CHEMICAL> deaminase to generate <CHEMICAL>2-ketobutyrate</CHEMICAL> from the commodity <CHEMICAL>amino acid l-threonine</CHEMICAL>, and the cloned alsS gene of B. subtilis 168 which eliminates <CHEMICAL>pyruvate</CHEMICAL>, the <CHEMICAL>keto acid</CHEMICAL> by-product of the reaction, through the formation of non-reactive acetolactate. The effect of the concerted action of these three enzymes on the overall biosynthesis of 2-aminobutyrate and the potential broader application of this type of biochemical engineering is described in this article.\nSection snippets\nCloning and expression of biocatalyst genes\nPlasmid pIF347 carries the cloned ilvA gene of E. coli K12.

Our data establish 3-HIB as a novel <disposition>adipocyte</disposition>-derived regulator of <disposition>adipocyte</disposition> subtypespecific functions strongly linked to <health_effect>obesity</health_effect>, insulin resistance, and type 2 <DISEASE>diabetes</DISEASE>. <DISEASE>Type 2 diabetes</DISEASE> is characterized by elevated circulating <CHEMICAL>glucose</CHEMICAL> and HbA1c, insulin resistance, <DISEASE>dyslipidemia</DISEASE>, and increased body fat mass, especially in the intra-abdominal region (1,2). Risk factors for type 2 <DISEASE>diabetes</DISEASE> include excessive caloric intake, central <health_effect>obesity</health_effect> with increased waist-to-hip ratio, sedentary lifestyle, increasing age, and multiple genetic factors (3,4). The insulin resistance and <DISEASE>dyslipidemia</DISEASE> associated with type 2 <DISEASE>diabetes</DISEASE> involve increased circulating <CHEMICAL>triacylglycerols</CHEMICAL> (TAG) and reduced HDL <CHEMICAL>cholesterol</CHEMICAL> (HDL-C). As a result, TAG/HDL-C ratio can serve as a surrogate measure of insulin resistance (5). Several studies have shown a strong association between insulin resistance and increased concentrations of circulating branched-chain amino acids (<CHEMICAL>BCAAs</CHEMICAL>; <CHEMICAL>valine</CHEMICAL>, <CHEMICAL>leucine</CHEMICAL>, and <CHEMICAL>isoleucine</CHEMICAL>) (6,7), also after controlling for age, BMI, sex, and race, although particular associations were observed for nonobese people and males with type 2 <DISEASE>diabetes</DISEASE> (8). Elevation of these <role>essential</role> <CHEMICAL>amino acids</CHEMICAL> in <health_effect>obesity</health_effect> and insulin resistance reflects, at least partly, reduced <CHEMICAL>BCAA</CHEMICAL> <process>catabolism</process> in <disposition>adipose tissue</disposition>, involving decreased expression and/or activity of <CHEMICAL>BCAA</CHEMICAL> <role>catabolic</role> enzymes (9\u201317). People with <health_effect>obesity</health_effect> exhibit reduced <process>catabolism</process> of <CHEMICAL>BCAAs</CHEMICAL> in visceral and subcutaneous <disposition>adipose tissue</disposition>, which is normalized after bariatric surgery (18). <CHEMICAL>BCAAs</CHEMICAL> provide <CHEMICAL>carbon</CHEMICAL> for de novo lipogenesis in adipocytes (19,20).", "output": [["3-Hydroxyisobutyrate", "involved in", "valine metabolism"], ["3-Hydroxyisobutyrate", "causes", "diabetes"], ["3-Hydroxyisobutyrate", "involved in", " insulin resistance"], ["3-Hydroxyisobutyrate", "involved in", "BCAA catabolism"]]}
{"input": "Metabolomics and metabolic pathway networks from <source>human</source> <DISEASE>colorectal cancers</DISEASE>, adjacent mucosa, and stool Abstract\nBackground: <DISEASE>Colorectal cancers</DISEASE> (<DISEASE>CRC</DISEASE>) are associated with perturbations in cellular <CHEMICAL>amino acids</CHEMICAL>, nucleotides, <CHEMICAL>pentose-phosphate</CHEMICAL> pathway carbohydrates, and glycolytic, gluconeogenic, and <CHEMICAL>tricarboxylic acid</CHEMICAL> intermediates. A non-targeted global metabolome approach was utilized for exploring <source>human</source> CRC, adjacent mucosa, and stool. In this pilot study, we identified <role>metabolite</role> profile differences between <DISEASE>CRC</DISEASE> and adjacent mucosa from patients undergoing colonic resection. Metabolic pathway analyses further revealed relationships between complex networks of metabolites.\nMethods: Seventeen <DISEASE>CRC</DISEASE> patients participated in this pilot study and provided CRC, adjacent mucosa ~10 cm proximal to the <DISEASE>tumor</DISEASE>, and stool. Metabolomes were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). All of the library standard identifications were confirmed and further analyzed via MetaboLync(TM) for metabolic network interactions.\nResults: There were a total of 728 distinct metabolites identified from colonic tissue and stool matrices. Nineteen metabolites significantly distinguished CRC from adjacent mucosa in our patient-matched cohort. Glucose-6-phosphate and <CHEMICAL>fructose-6-phosphate</CHEMICAL> demonstrated 0.64-fold and 0.75-fold lower expression in CRC compared to mucosa, respectively, whereas isobar: <CHEMICAL>betaine aldehyde</CHEMICAL>, <CHEMICAL>N-methyldiethanolamine</CHEMICAL>, and adenylosuccinate had 2.68-fold and 1.88-fold higher relative abundance in CRC. Eleven of the 19 metabolites had not previously been reported for CRC relevance. Metabolic pathway analysis revealed significant perturbations of <CHEMICAL>short-chain</CHEMICAL> <process>fatty acid metabolism</process>, fructose, mannose, and <process>galactose metabolism</process>, and glycolytic, gluconeogenic, and <process>pyruvate metabolism</process>. In comparison to the 500 stool metabolites identified from <source>human</source> <DISEASE>CRC</DISEASE> patients, only 215 of those stool metabolites were also detected in tissue. This CRC and stool metabolome investigation identified novel metabolites that may serve as key small molecules in CRC <process>pathogenesis</process>, confirmed the results from previously reported CRC metabolome studies, and showed networks for metabolic pathway aberrations. In addition, we found differences between the CRC and stool metabolomes.\nConclusions: Stool <role>metabolite</role> profiles were limited for direct associations with <DISEASE>CRC</DISEASE> and adjacent mucosa, yet <process>metabolic pathways</process> were conserved across both matrices. Larger patient-matched CRC, adjacent non-cancerous colonic mucosa, and stool cohort studies for <role>metabolite</role> profiling are needed to validate these small molecule differences and metabolic pathway aberrations for clinical application to CRC control, treatment, and prevention.\nKeywords: <health_effect>Cancer</health_effect>; <disposition>Colon</disposition> mucosa; <CHEMICAL>Colorectal</CHEMICAL>; <process>Metabolic pathways</process>; Metabolites; Metabolomics; Stool; <DISEASE>Tumor</DISEASE>.\n", "output": [["Glucose-6-phosphate", "involved in", "glycolytic metabolism"], ["Fructose-6-phosphate", "involved in", "glycolytic metabolism"], ["Fructose-6-phosphate", "biolocation is", "Saliva"], ["Glucose-6-phosphate", "biolocation is", "Saliva"]]}
