Cardiolipin is an anionic phospholipid predominantly found in mitochondrial membranes, playing a vital role in maintaining their structure and function. The biosynthesis of cardiolipin involves multiple pathways, with NADH being an essential cofactor for several steps. The first pathway involves the formation of cardiolipin with a CL(16:0/18:2(9Z,12Z)/22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)) structure, while the second pathway produces cardiolipin with a CL(15:0/16:1(9Z)/18:1(9Z)/18:3(9Z,12Z,15Z)) structure. The third pathway involves the formation of cardiolipin with a CL(16:1(9Z)/22:5(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)/18:1(11Z)/18:1(11Z)) structure.\n\nTriacylglycerols, on the other hand, serve as energy storage molecules and are synthesized through de novo pathways. The biosynthesis of triacylglycerols involves multiple steps, with NADH playing an essential role in several steps. The first pathway involves the formation of triacylglycerols with a TG(20:0/20:3(8Z,11Z,14Z)/22:4(7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)) structure, while the second pathway produces triacylglycerols with a TG(18:4(6Z,9Z,12Z,15Z)/14:0/20:5(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)) structure. The third pathway involves the formation of triacylglycerols with a TG(i-20:0/a-17:0/i-12:0) structure.\n\nIn conclusion, this review highlights the essential role of NADH in lipid biosynthesis, specifically in cardiolipin and triacylglycerol synthesis pathways.

The gliclazide action pathway is a complex network of enzymes and signaling molecules that work together to maintain glucose homeostasis.\n\nIn addition to its role in gliclazide action, calcium is also involved in glycerol metabolism IV (Glycerophosphoglycerol), a crucial pathway for energy production and lipid synthesis. Glycerophosphoglycerol is an essential component of glycerol metabolism, which is responsible for breaking down glycerol into its constituent parts and recycling them for energy production or lipid synthesis. The presence of calcium in this pathway suggests that it plays an important role in regulating glycerol metabolism and maintaining overall energy homeostasis.\n\nFurthermore, we have found that calcium can be sourced through plantain, a common food source rich in calcium and other essential nutrients. Plantain is known to have various health benefits, including its ability to regulate blood sugar levels and improve digestion. By consuming plantain, individuals can obtain calcium and potentially support both gliclazide action and glycerol metabolism IV (Glycerophosphoglycerol).\n\nIn conclusion, this study highlights the importance of calcium in gliclazide action and glycerol metabolism IV (Glycerophosphoglycerol) pathways. Understanding these relationships can help develop targeted therapeutic strategies for managing glucose homeostasis and energy metabolism. Additionally, consuming calcium-rich foods like plantain may provide a natural approach to support these essential processes.

{"input": "\n\nTitle: Tannins as Immunosuppressive Agents and Immunological Adjuvants: A Review\n\nBackground: Tannins, a class of plant polyphenols, have been found to possess various biological activities, including immunomodulatory effects. This review aims to explore the immunosuppressive and immunological adjuvant properties of tannins and their potential applications in immunotherapy.\n\nMethods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify relevant studies on tannins and their immunomodulatory effects. The search included databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The studies were then critically analyzed to identify key findings and conclusions.\n\nResults: Tannins have been shown to exhibit immunosuppressive properties, as they can inhibit the activation and proliferation of immune cells. This immunosuppressive effect can be attributed to their ability to bind to proteins and other molecules, thereby inhibiting signaling pathways and reducing inflammation. In addition to their immunosuppressive properties, tannins have also been found to act as immunological adjuvants. They can enhance the immune response by stimulating the production of cytokines and other immune mediators. This dual action of tannins suggests their potential use in immunotherapy for various diseases.\n\nConclusion: The immunomodulatory properties of tannins make them promising candidates for further investigation in immunotherapy. Their ability to act as both immunosuppressive agents and immunological adjuvants highlights their potential for treating autoimmune disorders, cancer, and other inflammatory conditions.

We have identified three distinct pathways involving cis-Vaccenoyl CoA, each leading to the formation of unique triacylglycerols and cardiolipins. The first pathway involves the formation of TG(18:0/18:1(11Z)/20:4(8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)), a triacylglycerol with a distinct fatty acid composition. The second pathway results in the production of CL(18:1(11Z)/18:3(6Z,9Z,12Z)/20:0/22:1(13Z)), a cardiolipin with specific fatty acid arrangement.

This review highlights the role of DHAP in the synthesis of specific TAGs and CLs, as well as its sourcing through blackcurrant-derived intermediates. DHAP is a critical component of the Kennedy pathway, which is responsible for the synthesis of TAGs and CLs. In this pathway, DHAP is utilized to generate glycerol-3-phosphate, which is then converted into TAGs and CLs through a series of enzymatic reactions.\n\nRecent research has shown that blackcurrant, a rich source of anthocyanins and other bioactive compounds, can provide DHAP through its metabolic pathways. The presence of blackcurrant-derived intermediates has been found to enhance the efficiency of TAG and CL synthesis, as well as modulate their composition. This is particularly relevant for the production of TAGs with specific fatty acid profiles, such as TG(15:0/18:3(6Z,9Z,12Z)/20:3(8Z,11Z,14Z)), which have potential applications in nutritional and pharmaceutical industries.\n\nFurthermore, the role of DHAP in cardiolipin biosynthesis has been investigated, with CLs being crucial components of the inner mitochondrial membrane, playing a vital role in cellular energy production.

The biosynthesis of CL involves several enzymatic reactions, including the participation of lysoPA(i-12:0/0:0).

The enzyme activity was measured using radiolabeled substrates and products, and the products were separated by thin-layer chromatography. In addition, we used molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the enzyme-substrate interactions and elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying lysoPA(i-12:0/0:0) involvement in CL biosynthesis.\n\nResults: Our results demonstrate that lysoPA(i-12:0/0:0) exhibits specificity towards different CL structures, with varying efficiency.

Cardiolipin, a phospholipid found primarily in mitochondrial membranes, plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial function and stability. The biosynthesis of cardiolipin involves the incorporation of four fatty acids, including CL(i-12:0/i-22:0/i-20:0/i-17:0). In this study, we demonstrate that LysoPA(0:0/16:0) is directly involved in cardiolipin biosynthesis, as it is required for the proper incorporation of these fatty acids.\n\nFurthermore, triacylglycerols are important storage lipids found in adipose tissue and other tissues, and their biosynthesis is essential for energy storage and release. In this study, we show that LysoPA(0:0/16:0) is also involved in de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis. We identified two distinct triacylglycerols, TG(24:1(15Z)/22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)/22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)) and TG(20:0/18:1(9Z)/22:5(7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)), which depend on LysoPA(0:0/16:0) for their formation.\n\nIn conclusion, our findings highlight the crucial role of LysoPA(0:0/16:0) in both cardiolipin and triacylglycerol biosynthesis, suggesting that it may be a key regulatory factor in lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function.

We focused on three different TG structures, TG(8:0/14:0/14:0), TG(8:0/i-24:0/14:0), and TG(21:0/20:0/14:0), and two different CL structures, CL(i-13:0/a-17:0/i-15:0/a-25:0) and CL(18:2(9Z,12Z)/20:1(13Z)/20:1(13Z)/22:1(13Z)). Our findings reveal that water is an essential component for the efficient synthesis of these lipid molecules.\n\nIn the de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis, water molecules facilitate the condensation of fatty acids, allowing for the formation of ester linkages between glycerol and fatty acids. This process is crucial for the generation of diverse TG structures with specific fatty acid compositions. The presence of water also affects the specificity of enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathway, which further contributes to the formation of distinct TG structures.\n\nIn cardiolipin biosynthesis, water is required for the proper assembly of the CL molecule. The presence of water ensures that the four fatty acid chains are correctly positioned and oriented, leading to the formation of a functional CL structure. Additionally, water molecules may also play a role in stabilizing the CL structure, preventing unwanted side reactions and ensuring its proper incorporation into cellular membranes.\n\nIn conclusion, our study highlights the importance of water as a key component in lipid biosynthesis, particularly in de novo triacylglycerol and cardiolipin synthesis.

The biosynthesis of cardiolipin involves several enzymatic reactions, including the participation of lyso-phosphatidic acid (LysoPA). In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of LysoPA(i-13:0/0:0) in four different cardiolipin biosynthesis pathways.\n\nMethods: We conducted an extensive literature review and analyzed published data on the role of LysoPA(i-13:0/0:0) in cardiolipin biosynthesis.

The biosynthesis of cardiolipin is a complex process involving several enzymes and cofactors, one of which is cytidine monophosphate (CMP). In this study, we investigated the diversity of cytidine monophosphates involved in cardiolipin biosynthesis.\n\nWe identified three distinct cytidine monophosphates (CMPs) that participate in cardiolipin biosynthesis, each with unique fatty acid compositions. The first CMP is associated with the formation of CL(12:0/16:1(9Z)/18:1(9Z)/18:1(11Z)), which contains fatty acids with varying chain lengths and double bond configurations. The second CMP is involved in the synthesis of CL(i-13:0/a-21:0/i-22:0/a-25:0), characterized by its unusual fatty acid composition with iso and anteiso branches. The third CMP is implicated in the formation of CL(16:0/18:0/18:2(9Z,12Z)/16:0), which has a more conventional fatty acid profile.\n\nOur findings highlight the diversity of cytidine monophosphates involved in cardiolipin biosynthesis and suggest that these distinct CMPs may play specific roles in modulating cardiolipin structure and function. Further investigation into the enzymes and regulatory mechanisms governing these CMPs could provide valuable insights into cardiolipin biosynthesis and its implications for mitochondrial health and function.\n\nIn conclusion, this study expands our understanding of cytidine monophosphates and their role in cardiolipin biosynthesis, revealing the complexity and diversity of this essential phospholipid.

This review focuses on the role of Cyclic AMP in intracellular signaling through the Luteinizing Hormone/Choriogonadotropin (LH/CG) receptor. The LH/CG receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor that is activated by luteinizing hormone (LH) and choriogonadotropin (CG). Upon activation, the receptor triggers intracellular signaling cascades, which ultimately lead to the production of Cyclic AMP.\n\nCyclic AMP is sourced through various natural sources, including Pili nut, Epazote, and eggplant. Pili nut, also known as Canarium ovatum, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, which contains a unique mixture of bioactive compounds that can stimulate the production of Cyclic AMP. Epazote, an herb commonly used in Mexican cuisine, has been reported to possess Cyclic AMP-stimulating properties. Eggplant, a popular vegetable, also contains compounds that can increase Cyclic AMP levels.\n\nThe activation of the LH/CG receptor by its ligands, LH and CG, leads to the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, an enzyme responsible for converting adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to Cyclic AMP. The elevated levels of Cyclic AMP then activate protein kinase A (PKA), which further modulates various cellular processes, including gene expression, cell growth, and differentiation.\n\nIn conclusion, Cyclic AMP plays a vital role in intracellular signaling through the LH/CG receptor, and its production can be stimulated by various natural sources, such as Pili nut, Epazote, and eggplant. Understanding the mechanisms underlying Cyclic AMP signaling is crucial for elucidating its role in various physiological processes and potentially developing novel therapeutics for various diseases.

Cardiolipin, a phospholipid found primarily in the inner mitochondrial membrane, is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and structure. It is composed of four fatty acyl chains, with the i-12:0/a-13:0/i-18:0/a-15:0 structure being one of its common forms. The biosynthesis of cardiolipin involves several enzymatic reactions, including the participation of PA(16:0/18:1(9Z)).\n\nIn addition to its role in cardiolipin biosynthesis, PA(16:0/18:1(9Z)) has also been implicated in de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis. Triacylglycerols are stored energy molecules found in adipose tissue and other tissues, and their biosynthesis involves the formation of glycerol backbones with various fatty acyl chains. Two different de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis pathways have been identified, both of which involve PA(16:0/18:1(9Z)). In the first pathway, triacylglycerols are synthesized with fatty acyl chains 18:1(9Z)/22:2(13Z,16Z)/22:1(13Z), while in the second pathway, they are synthesized with fatty acyl chains 18:1(11Z)/22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)/18:1(9Z).\n\nThis study highlights the importance of PA(16:0/18:1(9Z)) in both cardiolipin and triacylglycerol biosynthesis, suggesting that this molecule plays a key role in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and mitochondrial function.

Triacylglycerols, on the other hand, are storage lipids found in adipose tissue and serve as an energy reserve for the body.\n\nWe have identified that PA(16:0/18:1(9Z)) is involved in cardiolipin biosynthesis through its participation in the formation of CL(18:3(9Z,12Z,15Z)/20:4(8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)/20:4(8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)/20:5(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)). This indicates that PA(16:0/18:1(9Z)) contributes to the synthesis of cardiolipin molecules with specific acyl chain compositions, which could have implications for maintaining mitochondrial function and integrity.\n\nIn addition, we found that PA(16:0/18:1(9Z)) is also involved in de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis through its participation in the formation of TG(18:2(9Z,12Z)/22:5(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)/22:5(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)). This suggests that PA(16:0/18:1(9Z)) plays a role in the synthesis of triacylglycerols with specific acyl chain compositions, which could have implications for energy storage and lipid metabolism.\n\nIn conclusion, our findings highlight the dual role of PA(16:0/18:1(9Z)) in both cardiolipin and triacylglycerol biosynthesis, demonstrating its significance in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis and energy storage.

Cardiolipin (CL) is an essential phospholipid found in the inner mitochondrial membrane, playing a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial function and integrity. Triacylglycerols (TAGs) are storage lipids found in adipose tissue and other tissues, playing an essential role in energy storage and release.\n\nIn this study, we have identified ETP as a key component in both cardiolipin and triacylglycerol biosynthesis. We have found that ETP is involved in the biosynthesis of CL through a series of complex reactions involving multiple lipid species. These reactions include the condensation of ETP with other lipid molecules such as 22:5(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)/22:5(7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)/16:0 and 20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)/22:5(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)/22:5(7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)/16:0.\n\nFurthermore, we have demonstrated that ETP is also involved in de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis through a series of reactions involving different lipid species such as TG(20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)/20:4(8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)/18:4(6Z,9Z,12Z,15Z)) and TG(20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)/18:3(9Z,12Z,15Z)/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)). These reactions involve the condensation of ETP with other lipid molecules to form complex lipid structures.\n\nIn conclusion, our findings suggest that 1-(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphate plays a dual role in both cardiolipin and triacylglycerol biosynthesis.

In this study, we investigated the potential of horse and babassu palm as alternative sources for these compounds.\n\nMethods: We conducted in vitro experiments to determine the efficiency of horse and babassu palm in producing 6-PGL and 2MH. The horse samples were obtained from healthy adult horses, while babassu palm samples were collected from mature babassu palm trees. The samples were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to quantify the levels of 6-PGL and 2MH.\n\nResults: Our results showed that horse tissue contained significantly higher levels of 6-PGL compared to babassu palm (p < 0.05). In contrast, babassu palm had higher levels of 2MH compared to horse tissue (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that horse and babassu palm may be suitable alternative sources for 6-PGL and 2MH production, respectively.\n\nConclusion: The study demonstrates that horse and babassu palm can serve as alternative sources for 6-PGL and 2MH production.

In this study, we investigated the potential synergistic effects of alendronic acid, diguanosine triphosphate, and (S)-2-aceto-2-hydroxybutanoic acid on osteoporosis in ostriches.\n\nMethods: A total of 60 ostriches were divided into four groups: control (n=15), alendronic acid (n=15), diguanosine triphosphate (n=15), and combination therapy (n=15). The ostriches in the treatment groups received either alendronic acid, diguanosine triphosphate, or both for 12 weeks. Bone mineral density (BMD) and bone histomorphometry were assessed at baseline and after treatment. Serum biochemical markers of bone turnover were also measured.\n\nResults: After 12 weeks of treatment, significant increases in BMD were observed in both alendronic acid (13.4% increase) and diguanosine triphosphate (11.8% increase) groups compared to control (3.2% increase). The combination therapy group showed a significant increase in BMD (17.6%) compared to control. Serum biochemical markers of bone turnover were significantly reduced in all treatment groups compared to control. No significant side effects were reported in any of the treatment groups.\n\nConclusion: The results of this study suggest that alendronic acid and diguanosine triphosphate have potential synergistic effects on improving bone density and reducing bone turnover in ostriches with osteoporosis.

The exact cause of IBD is still unknown, but it is believed to involve an interaction between genetic, immune, and environmental factors. Recent studies have suggested that certain carnitines may play a role in the pathogenesis of IBD.\n\nMethods: In this study, we investigated the effects of various carnitines on IBD using in vitro and in vivo models.

This condition can be managed by increasing the intake of specific nutrients like L-Glutamic acid and Guanosine monophosphate. In this study, we explore the role of these nutrients in managing Xanthinuria Type I and their sources.\n\nL-Glutamic acid is an amino acid that plays a crucial role in the metabolism of xanthine and uric acid. It has been found to be involved in Xanthinuria Type I, as its deficiency can exacerbate the symptoms of the disorder. Sources of L-Glutamic acid include whey and flaxseed. Whey is a byproduct of cheese and dairy production and is rich in bioactive peptides and proteins. Flaxseed, on the other hand, is a plant-based source of omega-3 fatty acids and dietary fiber. Both sources can be incorporated into the diet to increase L-Glutamic acid intake.\n\nGuanosine monophosphate is another essential nutrient involved in the management of Xanthinuria Type I. It is a nucleotide and a precursor of Guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which is required for various cellular processes. The deficiency of Guanosine monophosphate can lead to an imbalance of GTP levels and may contribute to the severity of Xanthinuria Type I.\n\nIn conclusion, L-Glutamic acid and Guanosine monophosphate play essential roles in managing Xanthinuria Type I. By increasing their intake through dietary sources such as whey and flaxseed, individuals with this rare genetic disorder can potentially alleviate some of its symptoms and improve their overall health.

The biosynthesis of cardiolipin involves several phosphate molecules, which are essential for the formation of its unique structure. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of phosphate molecules in cardiolipin biosynthesis by examining key phosphate-containing triplet structures.\n\nMethods: We analyzed four different phosphate-containing triplet structures involved in cardiolipin biosynthesis, including CL(i-12:0/i-22:0/i-19:0/a-21:0), CL(i-13:0/i-21:0/i-13:0/i-14:0), CL(a-13:0/i-19:0/i-17:0/i-15:0), and CL(i-12:0/a-15:0/i-20:0/i-21:0). We used molecular dynamics simulations and computational methods to study the structure, stability, and dynamics of these triplet structures, as well as their interactions with other components of cardiolipin biosynthesis.\n\nResults: Our findings revealed that each of the four phosphate-containing triplet structures plays a distinct role in cardiolipin biosynthesis.

The second triplet, CL(i-13:0/i-21:0/i-13:0/i-14:0), is less stable but still plays an essential role in maintaining the overall structure of cardiolipin. The third triplet, CL(a-13:0/i-19:0/i-17:0/i-15:0), is more flexible and dynamic, allowing it to adapt to different environments within the mitochondrial membrane. Finally, the fourth triplet, CL(i-12:0/a-15:0/i-20:0/i-21:0), exhibits unique structural properties that may contribute to its specific function within cardiolipin biosynthesis.\n\nConclusion: This study provides valuable insights into the role of phosphate molecules in cardiolipin biosynthesis and highlights the importance of understanding the structure and dynamics of these key phosphate-containing triplet structures.

In cardiolipin biosynthesis, we identified phosphate groups with varying acyl chain lengths, such as CL(i-13:0/i-17:0/i-16:0/a-13:0), CL(i-14:0/a-15:0/i-22:0/i-22:0), and CL(a-13:0/i-21:0/i-15:0/a-13:0). In contrast, de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis involves phosphate groups with different compositions, such as TG(8:0/14:0/20:0). These results suggest that phosphate groups play a crucial role in determining the structure and function of cardiolipin and triacylglycerol molecules.\n\nConclusion: Our comparative analysis of phosphate groups in cardiolipin and triacylglycerol biosynthesis provides insights into the unique roles of these phosphate groups in lipid biosynthesis.

Its wave number disperses with excitation energy, its intensity decreases with increasing excitation energy, and it is always accompanied by another peak near 1450 cm\u22121, which acts similarly.

{"input": "The research reports the design and experimental results of novel gyroscopes based on nano-resistive sensing, capable to meet navigation grade specifications within a sensor footprint of 1.3 mm 2 and a total silicon structural volume of 0.026 mm 3 only. A significant increase of the scale-factor is obtained through a combination of (i) optimization of the Coriolis force transduction into a stress on the resistive gauges, (ii) increase of the drive motion amplitude and (iii) increase of the current through the sensing gauges. Combined with low-pressure eutectic packaging, this enables approaching the thermomechanical noise limits of the sensor at about 0.004 \u00b0 /\u221a hr. At the same time, electronics is developed with minimum demodulation phase errors, thus enabling optimized closed-loop quadrature compensation and minimization of drift effects. Thanks to the inherent rejection of parasitic couplings and associated drifts of the used technology, the overall stability reaches 0.02 \u00b0/hr on average on 6 samples. These performances are demonstrated for a 30-Hz system bandwidth and few hundred dps input range over several samples.

{"input": "Enzymes from extremophilic microorganisms usually catalyze chemical reactions in non-standard conditions. Such conditions promote aggregation, precipitation, and denaturation, reducing the activity of most non-extremophilic enzymes, frequently due to the absence of sufficient hydration. Some extremophilic enzymes maintain a tight hydration shell and remain active in solution even when liquid water is limiting, e.g. in the presence of high ionic concentrations, or at cold temperature when water is close to the freezing point. Extremophilic enzymes are able to compete for hydration via alterations especially to their surface through greater surface charges and increased molecular motion. These properties have enabled some extremophilic enzymes to function in the presence of non-aqueous organic solvents, with potential for design of useful catalysts. In this review, we summarize the current state of knowledge of extremophilic enzymes functioning in high salinity and cold temperatures, focusing on their strategy for function at low water activity. We discuss how the understanding of extremophilic enzyme function is leading to the design of a new generation of enzyme catalysts and their applications to biotechnology.", "output": []}

For this purpose, some mobile-phases were prepared with scalar acetonitrile concentrations. The best mobile phase for a complete separation of all molecules was composed of acetonitrile and 6 mM hydrochloric acid with 0.48 M sodium chloride solution (5%:95% v/v). The regression lines, obtained by a range of concentration between 62.5-0.5 ng/20 \u00b5litre for all substances showed very high values of R2 (\u223c1) indicating a very high sensitivity and accuracy (\u223c100%) of this new mobile phase in isocratic conditions. Temperature increase of postcolumn derivatization (50\u00b0C) with (OPA) showed a greater sensitivity for l-histidine and 3-methyl-l-histidine detection (\u223c70%). The new mobile phase in isocratic conditions produced a complete separation for all compounds and in particular between carnosine and 3-methyl-l-histidine. The high sensitivity of this HPLC method can detect histidine dipeptides and correlated compounds l-histidine and 3-methyl-l-histidine in animal tissues which can be present in different and very low concentrations. In addition, this very simple and fast method could be used in histidine dipeptides detection in biological compartments were their concentrations could be very low.", "output": []}

Among the 493 unrelated individuals from four ethnic groups (128 Baloch, 122 Pathan, 108 Punjabi, and 135 Sindhi), 82 haplotypes were observed with haplotype diversity (HD) of 0.9906 in Baloch, 102 haplotypes with HD value of 0.9957 in Pathans, 80 haplotypes with HD value of 0.9924 in Punjabi, and 105 haplotypes with HD value of 0.9945 in the Sindhi population. The overall gene diversity for Baloch, Pathan, Punjabi, and Sindhi populations was 0.6367, 0.6479, 0.6657, and 0.6112, respectively. The results had shown us that Pakistani populations do not have a unique set of genes but share the genetic affinity with regional (Central Asia and Northern India) populations. The observed low gene diversity (heterozygosity) values may be because of endogamy trends and this observation is equally supported by the results of forensic parameters which are mostly static across 4 combinations (minimal STRs, extended 11 Y-STRs, Powerplex 12 Y System, and Yfiler 17 Y-STRs) of STRs in these four populations.", "output": []}
