In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of phosphate in de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis, focusing on three specific triacylglycerol compositions.\n\nMethods: We used in vitro enzymatic assays and cellular models to examine the effects of phosphate on triacylglycerol biosynthesis. We analyzed the incorporation of phosphate into triacylglycerols with different fatty acid compositions, including TG(a-25:0/18:0/8:0), TG(i-20:0/a-15:0/i-19:0), and TG(20:3(5Z,8Z,11Z)/20:5(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)/20:5(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)).

This review aims to explore the diverse roles of ADP in different metabolic processes, including its involvement in phosphatidylinositol phosphate metabolism, D-glyceric aciduria, and triacylglycerol degradation.\n\nIn phosphatidylinositol phosphate metabolism, ADP plays a crucial role as an allosteric regulator of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC). By binding to PLC, ADP modulates its enzymatic activity and influences intracellular signaling pathways. This regulation is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper functioning of various cellular processes.\n\nIn D-glyceric aciduria, ADP is implicated as a key factor contributing to the pathogenesis of this genetic disorder. D-glyceric aciduria is characterized by the accumulation of D-glyceric acid in the urine due to a deficiency of glycerol kinase, an enzyme required for glycerol metabolism. The presence of ADP in this condition suggests its involvement in the regulation of glycerol kinase activity and glycerol metabolism.\n\nLastly, ADP is also implicated in triacylglycerol degradation, specifically in the degradation of triacylglycerol molecules containing specific fatty acid compositions such as TG(20:0/20:1(11Z)/22:1(13Z)). In this process, ADP may act as an allosteric regulator of lipases responsible for breaking down triacylglycerols into glycerol and free fatty acids.

In this study, we aimed to compare the sourcing of key amino acids and their derivatives in Linden and Vaccinium species.\n\nMethods: We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the chemical composition of various plant species, focusing on the presence of diamino-pimelic acid (DAP), 5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxylic acid (ARC), and S-lactoylglutathione (SLG). We collected samples of Linden (Tilia spp.) and Vaccinium species (Vaccinium spp., including blueberry, cranberry, and huckleberry) and analyzed their chemical composition using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry (MS).\n\nResults: Our analysis revealed that DAP was present in both Linden and Vaccinium species. However, the concentration of DAP was significantly higher in Vaccinium species compared to Linden. ARC was detected in both plant groups, but its concentration was higher in Linden species. SLG was found in both groups, but its concentration was higher in Vaccinium species.\n\nConclusion: This study demonstrates that both Linden and Vaccinium species contain key amino acids and their derivatives. The comparison of their concentrations suggests that Vaccinium species may be a better source for DAP and SLG, while Linden species may be more suitable for ARC.

In triacylglycerol biosynthesis, DHAP participates in the de novo synthesis of complex lipid structures, such as TG(18:3(6Z,9Z,12Z)/20:4(8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)/20:5(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)), TG(20:0/a-17:0/i-24:0), and TG(14:0/18:2(9Z,12Z)/22:2(13Z,16Z)). These complex lipids play crucial roles in energy storage and membrane functions. In addition to triacylglycerol biosynthesis, DHAP also contributes to phospholipid biosynthesis, specifically in the formation of CL(16:1(9Z)/10:0/14:0/14:0).

The fruits were homogenized and extracted using a combination of water and methanol. The extracts were then subjected to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis to quantify the levels of DXP and ERP.\n\nResults: The results showed that both papaya and mamey sapote contained significant amounts of DXP and ERP. The levels of DXP in papaya ranged from 1.3 to 1.7 mM, while in mamey sapote, they ranged from 1.1 to 1.4 mM.

In this study, we investigated the role of phosphatidic acid (PA) in Lupine, focusing on its involvement in de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis and cardiolipin biosynthesis.\n\nMethods: We used mass spectrometry to analyze the lipid composition of Lupine seeds and identified specific phosphatidic acid (PA) molecules involved in triacylglycerol and cardiolipin biosynthesis.

The first cardiolipin species, CL(14:0/14:1(9Z)/20:0/24:1(9Z)), consists of palmityl-CoA linked to fatty acids with 14 carbon atoms, 14 carbon atoms with a cis-9 double bond, 20 carbon atoms, and 24 carbon atoms with a cis-9 double bond. The second cardiolipin species, CL(16:0/18:1(9Z)/16:0/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)), contains palmityl-CoA linked to fatty acids with 16 carbon atoms, 18 carbon atoms with a cis-9 double bond, 16 carbon atoms, and 20 carbon atoms with four cis double bonds. The third cardiolipin species, CL(16:0/18:1(11Z)/22:5(7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)/18:1(11Z)), is composed of palmityl-CoA linked to fatty acids with 16 carbon atoms, 18 carbon atoms with a trans-11 double bond, 22 carbon atoms with five cis double bonds, and 18 carbon atoms with a trans-11 double bond. This study highlights the importance of palmityl-CoA in the diverse biosynthetic pathways of cardiolipin, which may have implications for understanding cellular energy production and mitochondrial function.

Additionally, we have characterized phosphates participating in de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis, including TG(19:0/22:0/i-20:0). Our findings highlight the importance of phosphates in lipid biosynthesis and emphasize their role as key regulatory components in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms and specific functions of these phosphates will provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between lipid metabolism and cellular processes.", "output": "[['Phosphate', 'involved in', 'Cardiolipin Biosynthesis CL(i-13:0/a-17:0/i-13:0/i-22:0)'], ['Phosphate', 'involved in', 'Cardiolipin Biosynthesis CL(a-13:0/i-19:0/a-25:0/i-14:0)'], ['Phosphate', 'involved in', 'Cardiolipin Biosynthesis CL(a-13:0/a-13:0/i-20:0/18:2(9Z,11Z))'], ['Phosphate', 'involved in', 'De Novo Triacylglycerol Biosynthesis TG(19:0/22:0/i-20:0)']]", "valid": true}

In this study, we investigate the role of LysoPA in cardiolipin and triacylglycerol biosynthesis. Cardiolipin is an essential phospholipid found in the inner mitochondrial membrane, while triacylglycerols are stored in adipose tissue and serve as an energy source.\n\nMethods:\nWe used a combination of molecular biology techniques and mass spectrometry to analyze the role of LysoPA in cardiolipin and triacylglycerol biosynthesis. We generated knockout cell lines and overexpressed LysoPA in different cellular models to study its effects on cardiolipin and triacylglycerol biosynthesis. Additionally, we performed lipidomic analyses to identify changes in lipid composition and metabolism.\n\nResults:\nOur results demonstrate that LysoPA is involved in cardiolipin biosynthesis through its interaction with specific cardiolipin species. We identified four distinct cardiolipin species associated with LysoPA in biosynthesis: CL(16:1(9Z)/18:1(11Z)/20:0/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)), CL(a-13:0/i-22:0/i-24:0/i-20:0), CL(i-12:0/i-14:0/i-13:0/i-19:0), and CL(14:1(11Z)/16:1(9Z)/18:1(11Z)/18:1(11Z)).
