{"input": "nan adenine, also known as 6-aminopurine or ade, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 6-aminopurines. these are purines that carry an amino group at position 6. purine is a bicyclic aromatic compound made up of a pyrimidine ring fused to an imidazole ring. adenine forms adenosine, a nucleoside, when attached to ribose, and deoxyadenosine when attached to deoxyribose, and it forms adenosine triphosphate (atp), a nucleotide, when three phosphate groups are added to adenosine. adenine is a drug which is used for nutritional supplementation, also for treating dietary shortage or imbalance. adenine is a strong basic compound (based on its pka). adenosine triphosphate is used in cellular metabolism as one of the basic methods of transferring chemical energy between reactions. adenine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to humans. in individuals suspected of suffering from a supraventricular tachycardia (svt), adenosine is used to help identify the rhythm. in humans, adenine is involved in riboflavin metabolism. adenine is a potentially toxic compound. adenine (sometimes known as vitamin b4) combines with the sugar ribose to form adenosine, which in turn can be bonded with from one to three phosphoric acid units, yielding amp, adp and atp . a modified form of adenosine monophosphate (cyclic amp) is an imporant secondary messenger in the propagation of many hormonal stimuli. adenine is an integral part of the structure of many coenzymes. adenine is one of four nitrogenous bases utilized in the synthesis of nucleic acids. certain svts can be successfully terminated with adenosine. adenosine (adenine with a ribose group) causes transient heart block in the av node of the heart. these adenine derivatives perform important functions in cellular metabolism. adenine forms adenosine, a nucleoside, when attached to ribose, and deoxyadenosine when attached to deoxyribose, and it forms adenosine triphosphate (atp), which drives many cellular metabolic processes by transferring chemical energy between reactions.", "output": [["pyrimidine", "subclass of", "nucleotide"], ["imidazole", "subclass of", "nucleotide"]]}
