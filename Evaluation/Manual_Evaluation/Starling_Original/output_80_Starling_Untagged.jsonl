Cardiolipin is an essential phospholipid found primarily in the inner mitochondrial membrane and plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function and integrity. The involvement of LPA in cardiolipin biosynthesis has been previously suggested; however, its specific role and mechanism remain unclear.

Further research is needed to elucidate the exact mechanism by which LPA contributes to cardiolipin biosynthesis and its potential implications for mitochondrial function and health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "valid": true}

In this study, we aimed to compare the sourcing of bioactive compounds from Nopal and Plains prickly pear.\n\nMethods: We analyzed the presence of six bioactive compounds in both plant sources using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry. The compounds analyzed were 6-deoxocathasterone, 4\u03b1-formyl-ergosta-7,24(241)-dien-3\u03b2-ol, methylglyoxal, and 6-deoxotyphasterol.\n\nResults: Our results showed that both Nopal and Plains prickly pear contained bioactive compounds of interest. The most abundant compound in both sources was 6-deoxocathasterone. However, there were differences in the concentration of other compounds.

Uroporphyrinogen III is an essential compound in heme biosynthesis and is found in both plants. In passion fruit, uroporphyrinogen III is sourced from fatty acids such as PA(18:3(9Z,12Z,15Z)/22:0), and 3-oxo-eicosatrienoyl-CoA. In hedge mustard, uroporphyrinogen III is derived from other sources. Additionally, \u03b1-D-ribose-1-phosphate is found in passion fruit, which may play a role in the metabolic pathway of uroporphyrinogen III. This research contributes to our understanding of the complex interactions between plant compounds and their potential roles in human health and nutrition.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe response is an array of the relevant triples in the form: [subject, predicate, object].\n\n[[\"Uroporphyrinogen III\", \"sourced through\", \"fatty acids such as PA(18:3(9Z,12Z,15Z)/22:0), and 3-oxo-eicosatrienoyl-CoA\"],\n[\"Uroporphyrinogen III\", \"sourced through\", \"other sources\"],\n[\"Uroporphyrinogen III\", \"involved in\", \"heme biosynthesis\"],\n[\"\u03b1-D-ribose-1-phosphate\", \"involved in\", \"uroporphyrinogen III\"]]\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe response is an array of the relevant triples in the form: [subject, predicate, object].\n\n[[\"Uroporphyrinogen III\", \"sourced through\", \"fatty acids such as PA(18:3(9Z,12Z,15Z)/22:0), and 3-oxo-eicosatrienoyl-CoA\"],\n[\"Uroporphyrinogen III\", \"sourced through\", \"other sources\"],\n[\"Uroporphyrinogen III\", \"involved in\", \"heme biosynthesis\"],\n[\"\u03b1-D-ribose-1-phosphate\", \"involved in\", \"uroporphyrinogen III\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "valid": true}

The involvement of LPA(0:0/18:2(9Z,12Z)) is demonstrated in the formation of triacylglycerols (TG) such as TG(20:0/i-22:0/i-12:0), TG(24:1(15Z)/22:4(7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)/22:4(7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)), and TG(20:0/18:0/12:0). Additionally, LPA(0:0/18:2(9Z,12Z)) is found to play a crucial role in cardiolipin biosynthesis, as evidenced by its involvement in the formation of cardiolipin (CL) species such as CL(i-12:0/i-14:0/a-13:0/i-24:0) and CL(a-13:0/a-13:0/i-20:0/i-17:0).

This study aims to compare the concentrations of DGG-Chl a and 1,7-DMU in Saskatoon berry and red algae, and to investigate their potential roles in photosynthesis and antioxidant properties.\n\nMethods: DGG-Chl a and 1,7-DMU concentrations were determined in Saskatoon berry and red algae samples using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The pigment content was correlated with photosynthetic efficiency and antioxidant capacity using in vitro assays.\n\nResults: The study found higher concentrations of DGG-Chl a in red algae compared to Saskatoon berry, while 1,7-DMU concentrations were higher in Saskatoon berry. The differences in pigment concentrations were correlated with variations in photosynthetic efficiency and antioxidant properties. DGG-Chl a and 1,7-DMU were found to play significant roles in photosynthesis and antioxidant defense mechanisms in both Saskatoon berry and red algae.\n\nConclusion: This study highlights the importance of DGG-Chl a and 1,7-DMU in photosynthesis and antioxidant properties in Saskatoon berry and red algae.

Triacylglycerols (TGs) and cardiolipins (CLs) are essential components of cellular membranes and play crucial roles in various cellular processes. The involvement of LPA(18:2(9Z,12Z)/0:0) in de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis is demonstrated through its participation in the formation of TG(21:0/10:0/i-13:0), TG(22:0/18:0/20:1(11Z)), and TG(14:0/15:0/15:1(9Z)/16:0).

These findings highlight the importance of LPA(18:2(9Z,12Z)/0:0) in the biosynthesis of both triacylglycerols and cardiolipins and suggest potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of lipid-related disorders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "valid": true}

These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying lipid metabolism and may contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for lipid-related disorders.\n\nA: [\"Phosphatidic Acid\", \"involved in\", \"de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis\"],\n          [\"Phosphatidic Acid\", \"involved in\", \"cardiolipin biosynthesis\"],\n          [\"Triacylglycerol\", \"involved in\", \"de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis\"]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "valid": true}

{"input": "\n\nTitle: Lysophospholipids and Alpha-Ketoisovaleric Acids in Jalapeno Pepper and Mule Deer: A Comparative Analysis\n\nBackground: Lysophospholipids and alpha-ketoisovaleric acids are bioactive molecules found in various sources. This study aims to compare and contrast the presence and properties of these molecules in Jalapeno peppers and Mule deer.\n\nMethods: Lysophospholipids and alpha-ketoisovaleric acids were extracted and analyzed from both Jalapeno peppers and Mule deer using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry. The molecular structures and properties of these molecules were determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.\n\nResults: Lysophospholipids were found to be present in both Jalapeno peppers and Mule deer, with differences in their molecular structures and properties. In Jalapeno peppers, lysophospholipids were mainly composed of saturated fatty acids, while in Mule deer, they contained a higher proportion of unsaturated fatty acids. Alpha-ketoisovaleric acids were also detected in both sources, with similar molecular structures but different properties.

The molecular structures and properties of these molecules were determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.\n\nResults: Lysophospholipids were found to be present in both Jalapeno peppers and Mule deer, with differences in their molecular structures and properties. In Jalapeno peppers, lysophospholipids were mainly composed of saturated fatty acids, while in Mule deer, they contained a higher proportion of unsaturated fatty acids. Alpha-ketoisovaleric acids were also detected in both sources, with similar molecular structures but different properties. In Jalapeno peppers, alpha-ketoisovaleric acids were found to be more abundant in the seeds, while in Mule deer, they were present in higher concentrations in the muscle tissue.\n\nConclusion: This study demonstrates the presence of lysophospholipids and alpha-ketoisovaleric acids in both Jalapeno peppers and Mule deer.

The role of phosphate in this process has been previously studied, but its specific involvement in the formation of different triacylglycerol compositions remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of phosphate in de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis, focusing on three specific triacylglycerol compositions.\n\nMethods: We used in vitro enzymatic assays and cellular models to examine the effects of phosphate on triacylglycerol biosynthesis. We analyzed the incorporation of phosphate into triacylglycerols with different fatty acid compositions, including TG(a-25:0/18:0/8:0), TG(i-20:0/a-15:0/i-19:0), and TG(20:3(5Z,8Z,11Z)/20:5(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)/20:5(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)). We also assessed the impact of phosphate on enzyme activities and gene expression related to triacylglycerol biosynthesis.\n\nResults: Our results showed that phosphate plays a crucial role in de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis, particularly in the formation of specific triacylglycerol compositions. We observed increased incorporation of phosphate into triacylglycerols with different fatty acid compositions, suggesting that phosphate may regulate triacylglycerol biosynthesis by modulating enzyme activities and gene expression. Furthermore, we found that phosphate-dependent enzymes, such as glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) and acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT), were significantly affected by phosphate levels.\n\nConclusion: This study highlights the importance of phosphate in de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis, particularly in the formation of specific triacylglycerol compositions. Our findings suggest that phosphate may play a key role in regulating enzyme activities and gene expression related to triacylglycerol biosynthesis, which could have implications for energy storage, cellular membrane formation, and overall metabolic health.

In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes and their potential implications for human health. We observed that LPA(18:2(9Z,12Z)/0:0) is involved in the synthesis of triacylglycerols (TGs), specifically TG(22:0/22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)/22:5(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)) and TG(18:3(6Z,9Z,12Z)/22:2(13Z,16Z)/22:2(13Z,16Z)).

We observed that LPA(18:2(9Z,12Z)/0:0) is involved in the synthesis of triacylglycerols (TGs), specifically TG(22:0/22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)/22:5(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)) and TG(18:3(6Z,9Z,12Z)/22:2(13Z,16Z)/22:2(13Z,16Z)).

In this study, we focused on the role of PA(18:1(9Z)/18:1(9Z)) in cardiolipin and triacylglycerol biosynthesis.\n\nMethods: We used a combination of molecular biology, biochemical, and lipidomic approaches to investigate the function of PA(18:1(9Z)/18:1(9Z)) in cardiolipin and triacylglycerol biosynthesis. We generated knockout cell lines and used mass spectrometry to analyze lipid profiles.\n\nResults: We found that PA(18:1(9Z)/18:1(9Z)) is involved in both cardiolipin and triacylglycerol biosynthesis. In cardiolipin biosynthesis, PA(18:1(9Z)/18:1(9Z)) is incorporated into CL(i-14:0/a-13:0/i-19:0/a-21:0) and CL(a-13:0/i-17:0/i-24:0/a-21:0). In triacylglycerol biosynthesis, PA(18:1(9Z)/18:1(9Z)) is incorporated into TG(14:1(9Z)/22:5(7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)/18:4(6Z,9Z,12Z,15Z)) and TG(22:1(13Z)/18:1(11Z)/22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)).

We also employed in vitro enzymatic assays to examine the effects of PA on cardiolipin and triacylglycerol synthesis.\n\nResults: Our results showed that PA(18:1(11Z)/18:1(11Z)) is involved in cardiolipin biosynthesis, as it was found in CL(18:1(9Z)/16:1(9Z)/22:5(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)/18:1(11Z)).

Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets for lipid metabolism-related diseases.\n\nThe answer is:\n\n[[\"Phosphatidic Acid (PA)\", \"involved in\", \"Cardiolipin biosynthesis\"],\n[\"Phosphatidic Acid (PA)\", \"involved in\", \"Triacylglycerol biosynthesis\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "valid": true}

In this study, we investigated the involvement of G3P in the biosynthesis of cardiolipin and triacylglycerols. We found that G3P is involved in the formation of different cardiolipin species, such as CL(a-13:0/18:2(9Z,11Z)/i-17:0/i-12:0), CL(14:0/16:1(11Z)/18:1(11Z)/20:1(13Z)), and CL(16:0/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)/20:5(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)/20:5(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)). Additionally, we observed that G3P is also involved in de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis, participating in the formation of TG(14:0/20:4(8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)/18:1(11Z)), TG(a-25:0/8:0/i-18:0), and TG(22:1(13Z)/20:3(5Z,8Z,11Z)/22:4(7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)). These findings highlight the versatile nature of G3P in lipid metabolism and its importance in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis.\n\nExplanation:\nThe paper discusses the role of G3P in the biosynthesis of cardiolipin and triacylglycerols. The relevant triples are:\n\n1. [\"Glycerol 3-Phosphate\", \"involved in\", \"cardiolipin biosynthesis\"]\n2. [\"Glycerol 3-Phosphate\", \"involved in\", \"triacylglycerol biosynthesis\"]\n\nThe paper provides specific examples of cardiolipin and triacylglycerol species that G3P is involved in, such as CL(a-13:0/18:2(9Z,11Z)/i-17:0/i-12:0), CL(14:0/16:1(11Z)/18:1(11Z)/20:1(13Z)), and CL(16:0/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)/20:5(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)/20:5(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)), and TG(14:0/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)/18:1(11Z)), TG(a-25:0/8:0/i-18:0), and TG(22:1(13Z)/20:3(5Z,8Z,11Z)/22:4(7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)).

This study investigates the role of CoA in de novo triacylglycerol (TG) and cardiolipin (CL) biosynthesis and its sourcing from Irish moss.\n\nMethods: We conducted in vitro experiments using purified CoA and cellular extracts containing enzymes responsible for triacylglycerol and cardiolipin synthesis. The effects of CoA on triacylglycerol biosynthesis were assessed using [18:0/20:5(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)/22:0] as a substrate. Similarly, cardiolipin biosynthesis was studied using [i-13:0/i-22:0/a-21:0/a-17:0] as a substrate. The role of Irish moss as a source of CoA was also investigated.\n\nResults: Our results showed that CoA is essential for de novo triacylglycerol and cardiolipin biosynthesis. The presence of CoA significantly increased the rate of triacylglycerol and cardiolipin synthesis. Furthermore, we found that Irish moss is a rich source of CoA, which can be utilized for these biosynthetic processes.\n\nConclusion: This study highlights the crucial role of CoA in de novo triacylglycerol and cardiolipin biosynthesis and demonstrates the potential of Irish moss as a natural source of CoA.

{"input": "\n\nTitle: Diverse Biolocations of Small Molecules in Blood\n\nAbstract: In this study, we investigate the biolocation of various small molecules in blood. We focus on seven distinct compounds: 7,7,8,8-Tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCQD), Dimethyltriazenoimidazole (DTI), [6-(5-Chloropyridin-2-yl)-7-hydroxypyrrolo[3,4-b]pyrazin-5-yl] 4-methylpiperazine-1-carboxylate (CPMPC), 3h-Sucrose (Suc), Isoniazid (INH), and 3-Hydroxydodec-5-enedioylcarnitine (HDDC). Our results reveal that all these compounds exhibit distinct biolocations within blood.\n\nTCQD is found to be primarily located in blood plasma, while DTI is predominantly found in red blood cells. CPMPC is also found in blood plasma, but with a lower concentration compared to TCQD. Suc is mainly present in blood plasma as well, with a slightly higher concentration than TCQD. INH is found in both blood plasma and red blood cells, with a higher concentration in blood plasma. Lastly, HDDC is found in both blood plasma and red blood cells, with a higher concentration in blood plasma as well.\n\nThese findings provide valuable insights into the distribution of these small molecules within blood and may contribute to our understanding of their biological functions and potential therapeutic applications.

We focus on seven distinct compounds: 7,7,8,8-Tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCQD), Dimethyltriazenoimidazole (DTI), [6-(5-Chloropyridin-2-yl)-7-hydroxypyrrolo[3,4-b]pyrazin-5-yl] 4-methylpiperazine-1-carboxylate (CPMPC), 3h-Sucrose (Suc), Isoniazid (INH), and 3-Hydroxydodec-5-enedioylcarnitine (HDDC). Our results reveal that all these compounds exhibit distinct biolocations within blood.\n\nTCQD is found to be primarily located in blood plasma, while DTI is predominantly found in red blood cells. CPMPC is also found in blood plasma, but with a lower concentration compared to TCQD. Suc is mainly present in blood plasma as well, with a slightly higher concentration than TCQD. INH is found in both blood plasma and red blood cells, with a higher concentration in blood plasma. Lastly, HDDC is found in both blood plasma and red blood cells, with a higher concentration in blood plasma as well.\n\nThese findings provide valuable insights into the distribution of these small molecules within blood and may contribute to our understanding of their biological functions and potential therapeutic applications. Further research is needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms underlying their biolocations and to explore potential interactions with other blood components.\n\nA: [\"TCQD\", \"biolocation is\", \"blood plasma\"],\n[\"DTI\", \"biolocation is\", \"red blood cells\"],\n[\"CPMPC\", \"biolocation is\", \"blood plasma\"],\n[\"Suc\", \"biolocation is\", \"blood plasma\"],\n[\"INH\", \"biolocation is\", \"blood plasma\"],\n[\"INH\", \"biolocation is\", \"red blood cells\"],\n[\"HDDC\", \"biolocation is\", \"blood plasma\"],\n[\"HDDC\", \"biolocation is\", \"red blood cells\"]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "valid": true}

The metabolites identified include GDP-L-galactose, propionic acid, 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene, citicoline, and 3-[(3aS,4S,7aS)-7a-methyl-1,5-dioxo-octahydro-1H-inden-4-yl]propanoyl-CoA. The Fireweed plant was found to be an abundant source of GDP-L-galactose and propionic acid, which have potential uses in pharmaceuticals and chemical industries. Additionally, 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene, a compound with potential applications in explosives and dyes, was also identified in Fireweed. Highbush blueberry was found to be an abundant source of GDP-L-galactose, which has potential applications in medicine and food industries. Citicoline, another compound with potential applications in medicine and nutrition, was also identified in Highbush blueberry. Furthermore, 3-[(3aS,4S,7aS)-7a-methyl-1,5-dioxo-octahydro-1H-inden-4-yl]propanoyl-CoA, a compound with potential applications in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, was also identified in both Fireweed and Highbush blueberry.

The bioactive compounds found in sheep products such as mutton and lamb have been of interest to researchers due to their potential health benefits. In this study, we aimed to investigate the presence and sources of various bioactive compounds in sheep products.\n\nMethods: We analyzed the presence of bioactive compounds in sheep products using various analytical techniques. The compounds studied include 19-hydroxytestosterone, 2-ketohexanoic acid, 15-KETE, pteroyltriglutamic acid, taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate, and ganglioside GD3 (d18:1/22:0). We also examined the potential sources of these compounds in sheep products.\n\nResults: Our results showed that sheep products contain various bioactive compounds with potential health benefits. The presence of these compounds was found to be influenced by factors such as breed, age of the sheep, and geographical location. For instance, 19-hydroxytestosterone was found to be sourced primarily from sheep adipose tissue, while 2-ketohexanoic acid was found in both adipose tissue and muscle. Similarly, 15-KETE was found in sheep adipose tissue and pteroyltriglutamic acid in liver. Taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate was detected in sheep bile, and ganglioside GD3 (d18:1/22:0) was found in both adipose tissue and milk.\n\nConclusion: This study highlights the presence of various bioactive compounds in sheep products and their potential sources. Further research is needed to understand the bioavailability and health effects of these compounds in humans. The findings of this study may contribute to the development of new functional foods and nutraceuticals derived from sheep products.

In cardiolipin biosynthesis, G3P is involved in the formation of complex lipids such as CL(10:0/23:1(9Z)/10:0/23:1(9Z)) and CL(i-14:0/a-13:0/i-16:0/a-13:0). These cardiolipins are essential components of the inner mitochondrial membrane, contributing to its structure and function. In phospholipid biosynthesis, G3P participates in the formation of CL(12:0(3-OH)/17:0cycw7/12:0(3-OH)/17:0cycw7), which is a unique lipid species with a cyclopropane ring.\n\nIn de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis, G3P is involved in the synthesis of TG(18:1(9Z)/22:2(13Z,16Z)/22:1(13Z)) and TG(8:0/a-21:0/a-21:0), which serve as energy storage molecules in adipose tissue. Additionally, G3P is implicated in triacylglycerol degradation, where it contributes to the breakdown of TG(16:0/20:0/22:1(13Z)) through various enzymatic reactions. This versatile lipid intermediate plays a critical role in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis and ensuring proper functioning of cellular membranes and organelles.\n\nIn conclusion, glycerol 3-phosphate is an essential lipid intermediate that participates in multiple biosynthetic pathways, including cardiolipin, phospholipid, de novo triacylglycerol, and triacylglycerol degradation.

Understanding its role in these pathways is crucial for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying lipid metabolism and its potential implications in various diseases.\n\nA: [\"Glycerol 3-Phosphate\", \"involved in\", \"Cardiolipin biosynthesis\"],\n          [\"Glycerol 3-Phosphate\", \"involved in\", \"Phospholipid biosynthesis\"],\n          [\"Glycerol 3-Phosphate\", \"involved in\", \"De novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis\"],\n          [\"Glycerol 3-Phosphate\", \"involved in\", \"Triacylglycerol degradation\"]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "valid": true}

Phosphatidic acid, a key molecule in cellular signaling and membrane biogenesis, is found to be involved in both cardiolipin and triacylglycerol biosynthesis. Cardiolipin, a crucial component of the inner mitochondrial membrane, is synthesized through a series of enzymatic reactions involving PA. The involvement of PA in cardiolipin biosynthesis is demonstrated through the presence of PA(18:1(9Z)/18:1(11Z)) in CL(20:1(11Z)/20:1(11Z)/20:1(11Z)/20:1(11Z)), CL(i-14:0/i-16:0/i-21:0/i-21:0), CL(i-12:0/18:2(9Z,11Z)/i-16:0/a-13:0), and CL(a-13:0/i-20:0/a-21:0/i-17:0). In addition, PA is also found to be involved in de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis, as evidenced by its presence in TG(16:1(9Z)/15:0/20:5(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)), TG(18:0/22:5(7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)/22:5(7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)), and TG(18:0/22:5(7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)/22:5(7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)).

These findings highlight the importance of phosphatidic acid in both cardiolipin and triacylglycerol biosynthesis, and suggest potential therapeutic targets for diseases involving disruptions in these lipid metabolic pathways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "valid": true}

These findings highlight the versatile nature of isopentadecanoyl-CoA and its essential role in lipid metabolism, particularly in the synthesis of cardiolipin and triacylglycerols.\n\nA: [\"Isopentadecanoyl-CoA\", \"sourced through\", \"fatty acid metabolism\"],\n[\"Isopentadecanoyl-CoA\", \"involved in\", \"cardiolipin biosynthesis\"],\n[\"Isopentadecanoyl-CoA\", \"involved in\", \"triacylglycerol biosynthesis\"]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "valid": true}

In this study, we investigated the role of PA(18:1(11Z)/18:1(11Z)) in cardiolipin and triacylglycerol biosynthesis.\n\nMethods: We used a combination of molecular biology, biochemical, and bioinformatics approaches to analyze the involvement of PA(18:1(11Z)/18:1(11Z)) in cardiolipin and triacylglycerol biosynthesis. We examined the expression levels of genes encoding enzymes involved in cardiolipin and triacylglycerol biosynthesis in cells treated with or without PA(18:1(11Z)/18:1(11Z)).

In this study, we aimed to compare the chemical composition of Savoy cabbage and Garland chrysanthemum, focusing on various bioactive compounds.\n\nMethods: We analyzed the chemical composition of both vegetables using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The samples were prepared by homogenizing fresh leaves and extracting the bioactive compounds using organic solvents. The extracts were then analyzed for their chemical composition.\n\nResults: Our results showed that both Savoy cabbage and Garland chrysanthemum contained various bioactive compounds. In particular, we identified carbamic acid, acetate, folic acid, ent-Kaur-16-en-19-al, and 3-Oxohexacosyl-CoA as key bioactive compounds in both vegetables. However, we observed differences in their concentrations between the two vegetables. For instance, carbamic acid and acetate were more abundant in Savoy cabbage, while folic acid and ent-Kaur-16-en-19-al were more abundant in Garland chrysanthemum. Additionally, 3-Oxohexacosyl-CoA was found exclusively in Savoy cabbage.\n\nConclusion: Our study highlights the differences in chemical composition between Savoy cabbage and Garland chrysanthemum. These differences may contribute to their distinct nutritional profiles and potential health benefits. Further research is needed to elucidate the specific roles of these bioactive compounds in human health and their potential applications in functional foods and nutraceuticals.", "output": [], "output_complete": "\n          The task is to extract chemical-related triples from scientific research papers.\n          The rules are:\n          1.

Our findings provide insights into the complexity of cardiolipin biosynthesis and suggest potential therapeutic targets for diseases involving cardiolipin dysfunction, such as neurodegenerative disorders and cardiovascular diseases.\n\nA: [\"Cardiolipin\", \"biolocation is\", \"mitochondrial membranes\"],\n[\"Cardiolipin\", \"involved in\", \"energy production\"],\n[\"Cardiolipin\", \"involved in\", \"cell signaling\"]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "valid": true}

{"input": "\n\nTitle: Biolocation of Various Compounds in Blood\n\nAbstract: This study investigates the biolocation of various compounds in blood, focusing on N-(2-(Mercaptomethyl)-3-phenylbutanoyl)-L-alanine, Deoxyadenosine, 3,4,5-Trihydroxybenzaldehyde, and 3-(2-Ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl)phthalic acid. The biolocation of these compounds was determined through in vitro and in vivo experiments, as well as through computational simulations.

In this study, we investigate the role of different types of PA in de novo triacylglycerol and cardiolipin biosynthesis.\n\nMethods: We analyzed the involvement of different types of PA in triacylglycerol biosynthesis and cardiolipin biosynthesis using a combination of molecular biology techniques, lipidomic analysis, and computational modeling.\n\nResults: Our results reveal that phosphatidic acid (PA) with different fatty acid compositions, such as PA(18:1(11Z)/18:1(9Z)), plays distinct roles in de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis. We identified several triacylglycerol species, including TG(20:2(11Z,14Z)/22:5(7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)/22:4(7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)), TG(8:0/15:0/13:0), and TG(22:2(13Z,16Z)/24:1(15Z)/22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)), which are significantly affected by the presence of different types of PA.

In this study, we investigated the metabolomic profile of mule deer saliva to identify potential biomarkers and explore their potential health benefits.\n\nMethods: Saliva samples were collected from mule deer and analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to identify and quantify metabolites present. The identified metabolites were then subjected to statistical analysis to identify significant differences between groups.\n\nResults: Our analysis revealed several novel metabolites in mule deer saliva, including tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone, indoleacetic acid, trihydroxycoprostanoic acid, 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 25-(beta-glucuronide), ganglioside GA1 (d18:1/26:1(17Z)), and diacetyl.

{"input": "\n\nTitle: The Multifaceted Roles of Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) in Cellular Metabolic Pathways\n\nAbstract: Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) is an essential molecule involved in various cellular metabolic pathways. This review aims to explore the diverse roles of ADP in different metabolic processes, including its involvement in phosphatidylinositol phosphate metabolism, D-glyceric aciduria, and triacylglycerol degradation.\n\nIn phosphatidylinositol phosphate metabolism, ADP plays a crucial role as an allosteric regulator of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC). By binding to PLC, ADP modulates its enzymatic activity and influences intracellular signaling pathways. This regulation is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper functioning of various cellular processes.\n\nIn D-glyceric aciduria, ADP is implicated as a key factor contributing to the pathogenesis of this genetic disorder. D-glyceric aciduria is characterized by the accumulation of D-glyceric acid in the urine due to a deficiency of glycerol kinase, an enzyme required for glycerol metabolism. The presence of ADP in this condition suggests its involvement in the regulation of glycerol kinase activity and glycerol metabolism.\n\nLastly, ADP is also implicated in triacylglycerol degradation, specifically in the degradation of triacylglycerol molecules containing specific fatty acid compositions such as TG(20:0/20:1(11Z)/22:1(13Z)). In this process, ADP may act as an allosteric regulator of lipases responsible for breaking down triacylglycerols into glycerol and free fatty acids. This degradation is essential for providing energy and maintaining lipid homeostasis in cells.\n\nIn conclusion, ADP is a versatile molecule with multiple roles in cellular metabolic pathways.

This review aims to explore the diverse roles of ADP in different metabolic processes, including its involvement in phosphatidylinositol phosphate metabolism, D-glyceric aciduria, and triacylglycerol degradation.\n\nIn phosphatidylinositol phosphate metabolism, ADP plays a crucial role as an allosteric regulator of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC). By binding to PLC, ADP modulates its enzymatic activity and influences intracellular signaling pathways. This regulation is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper functioning of various cellular processes.\n\nIn D-glyceric aciduria, ADP is implicated as a key factor contributing to the pathogenesis of this genetic disorder. D-glyceric aciduria is characterized by the accumulation of D-glyceric acid in the urine due to a deficiency of glycerol kinase, an enzyme required for glycerol metabolism. The presence of ADP in this condition suggests its involvement in the regulation of glycerol kinase activity and glycerol metabolism.\n\nLastly, ADP is also implicated in triacylglycerol degradation, specifically in the degradation of triacylglycerol molecules containing specific fatty acid compositions such as TG(20:0/20:1(11Z)/22:1(13Z)). In this process, ADP may act as an allosteric regulator of lipases responsible for breaking down triacylglycerols into glycerol and free fatty acids. This degradation is essential for providing energy and maintaining lipid homeostasis in cells.\n\nIn conclusion, ADP is a versatile molecule with multiple roles in cellular metabolic pathways. Its involvement in phosphatidylinositol phosphate metabolism, D-glyceric aciduria, and triacylglycerol degradation highlights its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper functioning of various metabolic processes. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and regulatory networks involving ADP in these pathways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "valid": true}

{"input": "Trehalose metabolism in plants Trehalose is a quantitatively important compatible solute and stress protectant in many organisms, including green algae and primitive plants. These functions have largely been replaced by sucrose in vascular plants, and trehalose metabolism has taken on new roles. Trehalose is a potential signal metabolite in plant interactions with pathogenic or symbiotic micro-organisms and herbivorous insects. It is also implicated in responses to cold and salinity, and in regulation of stomatal conductance and water-use efficiency. In plants, as in other eukaryotes and many prokaryotes, trehalose is synthesized via a phosphorylated intermediate, trehalose 6-phosphate (Tre6P). A meta-analysis revealed that the levels of Tre6P change in parallel with sucrose, which is the major product of photosynthesis and the main transport sugar in plants. We propose the existence of a bi-directional network, in which Tre6P is a signal of sucrose availability and acts to maintain sucrose concentrations within an appropriate range. Tre6P influences the relative amounts of sucrose and starch that accumulate in leaves during the day, and regulates the rate of starch degradation at night to match the demand for sucrose. Mutants in Tre6P metabolism have highly pleiotropic phenotypes, showing defects in embryogenesis, leaf growth, flowering, inflorescence branching and seed set. It has been proposed that Tre6P influences plant growth and development via inhibition of the SNF1-related protein kinase (SnRK1). However, current models conflict with some experimental data, and do not completely explain the pleiotropic phenotypes exhibited by mutants in Tre6P metabolism. Additional explanations for the diverse effects of alterations in Tre6P metabolism are discussed.", "output": [["Trehalose", "sourced through", "phosphorylated intermediate"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "sourced through", "phosphorylated intermediate"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "biolocation is", "plants"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "biolocation is", "eukaryotes"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "biolocation is", "prokaryotes"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "involved in", "sucrose availability"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "involved in", "sucrose concentration"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "relative amounts of sucrose and starch"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "rate of starch degradation"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "plant growth and development"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "embryogenesis"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "leaf growth"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "flowering"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "inflorescence branching"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "seed set"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "plant growth and development via inhibition of the SNF1-related protein kinase (SnRK1)"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "pleiotropic phenotypes"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "defects in embryogenesis"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "leaf growth"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "flowering"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "inflorescence branching"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "seed set"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "plant growth and development via inhibition of the SNF1-related protein kinase (SnRK1)"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "diverse effects of alterations in Trehalose 6-phosphate metabolism"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "sucrose availability"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "sucrose concentration"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "relative amounts of sucrose and starch"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "rate of starch degradation"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "plant growth and development"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "embryogenesis"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "leaf growth"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "flowering"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "inflorescence branching"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "seed set"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "plant growth and development via inhibition of the SNF1-related protein kinase (SnRK1)"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "pleiotropic phenotypes"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "defects in embryogenesis"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "leaf growth"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "flowering"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "inflorescence branching"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "seed set"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "plant growth and development via inhibition of the SNF1-related protein kinase (SnRK1)"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "diverse effects of alterations in Trehalose 6-phosphate metabolism"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "sucrose availability"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "sucrose concentration"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "relative amounts of sucrose and starch"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "rate of starch degradation"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "plant growth and development"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "embryogenesis"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "leaf growth"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "flowering"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "inflorescence branching"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "seed set"], ["Trehalose 6-phosphate", "influences", "plant growth and development via inhibition of the SNF1-related protein kinase (SnRK1)"]], "output_complete": "\n          The task is to extract chemical-related triples from scientific research papers.\n          The rules are:\n          1.

These functions have largely been replaced by sucrose in vascular plants, and trehalose metabolism has taken on new roles. Trehalose is a potential signal metabolite in plant interactions with pathogenic or symbiotic micro-organisms and herbivorous insects. It is also implicated in responses to cold and salinity, and in regulation of stomatal conductance and water-use efficiency. In plants, as in other eukaryotes and many prokaryotes, trehalose is synthesized via a phosphorylated intermediate, trehalose 6-phosphate (Tre6P). A meta-analysis revealed that the levels of Tre6P change in parallel with sucrose, which is the major product of photosynthesis and the main transport sugar in plants. We propose the existence of a bi-directional network, in which Tre6P is a signal of sucrose availability and acts to maintain sucrose concentrations within an appropriate range. Tre6P influences the relative amounts of sucrose and starch that accumulate in leaves during the day, and regulates the rate of starch degradation at night to match the demand for sucrose. Mutants in Tre6P metabolism have highly pleiotropic phenotypes, showing defects in embryogenesis, leaf growth, flowering, inflorescence branching and seed set. It has been proposed that Tre6P influences plant growth and development via inhibition of the SNF1-related protein kinase (SnRK1). However, current models conflict with some experimental data, and do not completely explain the pleiotropic phenotypes exhibited by mutants in Tre6P metabolism. Additional explanations for the diverse effects of alterations in Tre6P metabolism are discussed.\n          A: [\"Trehalose\", \"sourced through\", \"phosphorylated intermediate\"],\n

{"input": "Alpha-lipoic acid as a biological antioxidant \u03b1-Lipoic acid, which plays an essential role in mitochondrial dehydrogenase reactions, has recently gained considerable attention as an antioxidant.

It also protects membranes by interacting with vitamin C and glutathione, which may in turn recycle vitamin E. In addition to its antioxidant activities, dihydrolipoate may exert prooxidant actions through reduction of iron. \u03b1-Lipoic acid administration has been shown to be beneficial in a number of oxidative stress models such as ischemia-reperfusion injury, diabetes (both \u03b1-lipoic acid and dihydrolipoic acid exhibit hydrophobic binding to proteins such as albumin, which can prevent glycation reactions), cataract formation, HIV activation, neurodegeneration, and radiation injury. Furthermore, lipoate can function as a redox regulator of proteins such as myoglobin, prolactin, thioredoxin and NF-\u03baB transcription factor.

Lipoate, or its reduced form, dihydrolipoate, reacts with reactive oxygen species such as superoxide radicals, hydroxyl radicals, hypochlorous acid, peroxyl radicals, and singlet oxygen. It also protects membranes by interacting with vitamin C and glutathione, which may in turn recycle vitamin E. In addition to its antioxidant activities, dihydrolipoate may exert prooxidant actions through reduction of iron. \u03b1-Lipoic acid administration has been shown to be beneficial in a number of oxidative stress models such as ischemia-reperfusion injury, diabetes (both \u03b1-lipoic acid and dihydrolipoic acid exhibit hydrophobic binding to proteins such as albumin, which can prevent glycation reactions), cataract formation, HIV activation, neurodegeneration, and radiation injury. Furthermore, lipoate can function as a redox regulator of proteins such as myoglobin, prolactin, thioredoxin and NF-\u03baB transcription factor. We review the properties of lipoate in terms of (1) reactions with reactive oxygen species; (2) interactions with other antioxidants; (3) beneficial effects in oxidative stress models or clinical

Specifically, novel roles for biotin in cell signaling, gene expression, and chromatin structure have been identified in recent years. Human cells accumulate biotin by using both the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter and monocarboxylate transporter 1. These transporters and other biotin-binding proteins partition biotin to compartments involved in biotin signaling: cytoplasm, mitochondria, and nuclei. The activity of cell signals such as biotinyl-AMP, Sp1 and Sp3, nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB, and receptor tyrosine kinases depends on biotin supply. Consistent with a role for biotin and its catabolites in modulating these cell signals, greater than 2000 biotin-dependent genes have been identified in various human tissues. Many biotin-dependent gene products play roles in signal transduction and localize to the cell nucleus, consistent with a role for biotin in cell signaling. Posttranscriptional events related to ribosomal activity and protein folding may further contribute to effects of biotin on gene expression. Finally, research has shown that biotinidase and holocarboxylase synthetase mediate covalent binding of biotin to histones (DNA-binding proteins), affecting chromatin structure; at least seven biotinylation sites have been identified in human histones. Biotinylation of histones appears to play a role in cell proliferation, gene silencing, and the cellular response to DNA repair.

Consistent with a role for biotin and its catabolites in modulating these cell signals, greater than 2000 biotin-dependent genes have been identified in various human tissues. Many biotin-dependent gene products play roles in signal transduction and localize to the cell nucleus, consistent with a role for biotin in cell signaling. Posttranscriptional events related to ribosomal activity and protein folding may further contribute to effects of biotin on gene expression. Finally, research has shown that biotinidase and holocarboxylase synthetase mediate covalent binding of biotin to histones (DNA-binding proteins), affecting chromatin structure; at least seven biotinylation sites have been identified in human histones. Biotinylation of histones appears to play a role in cell proliferation, gene silencing, and the cellular response to DNA repair. Roles for biotin in cell signaling and chromatin structure are consistent with the notion that biotin has a unique significance in cell biology.\n          A: [\"Biotin\", \"sourced through\",

{"input": "Analysis of genes and metabolites associated with propamocarb hydrochloride response in tobacco Propamocarb hydrochloride is a systemic fungicide used against Pythium and Phytophthora as well as other diseases in tobacco. This study aimed to understand the response of tobacco to propamocarb hydrochloride treatment at the transcriptome and metabolome levels. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses were conducted on tobacco leaves treated with or without propamocarb hydrochloride to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differential metabolites, which were used for further functional enrichment analyses. In all, 1364 to 2497 DEGs and 34 differential metabolites were identified in different comparable groups. The DEGs were significantly involved in functions related to photosynthesis and valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation.

This study aimed to understand the response of tobacco to propamocarb hydrochloride treatment at the transcriptome and metabolome levels. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses were conducted on tobacco leaves treated with or without propamocarb hydrochloride to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differential metabolites, which were used for further functional enrichment analyses. In all, 1364 to 2497 DEGs and 34 differential metabolites were identified in different comparable groups. The DEGs were significantly involved in functions related to photosynthesis and valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation. Differential metabolites were mainly associated with arginine and proline metabolism (1,3-diaminopropane; 4-aminobutyric acid; and N-(omega)-hydroxyarginine) and glycerophospholipid metabolism (lysoPC(16:0), phosphorylcholine, and triethanolamine).

{"input": "Is there a really resistance to scabies treatment with permethrin? In vitro killing activity of permethrin on Sarcoptes scabiei from patients with resistant scabies\n Recently, there have been increased scabies infestations but many patients do not respond to treatment. Clinicians are hesitant to use permethrin despite the fact that treatment failure may be due to noncompliance with the treatment rather than permethrin resistance. We aimed to investigate the permethrin resistance of mites collected from patients who have endured scabies for at least 3 months despite permethrin treatment. Parasites in patients who had scabies for at least 3 months despite permethrin treatment were collected. Only parasites that were not damaged during sampling, not fragmented and had full motion were included. Parasites were divided into four groups, each with 15 parasites. Immersion oil was dripped on the control group and 5%, 7%, and 10% permethrin was added to the study groups. The responses of the parasites to the applied agents were examined using a digital microscope. All solutions, except the control group, killed the scabies mite. The mean survival time (ST) in the 5%, 7%, and 10% permethrin groups was 360\u2009\u00b1\u200933.2, 340\u2009\u00b1\u200931.4, and 320\u2009\u00b1\u200930.2 min, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean ST in the permethrin groups. The mean ST in the control group was 46\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5 h. The mean ST difference between the control and permethrin-treated groups was significant (p =\u20090.03).

{"input": "Dactinomycin induces complete remission associated with nucleolar stress response in relapsed/refractory NPM1-mutated AML Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with mutated NPM1 accounts for one-third of newly diagnosed AML. Despite recent advances, treatment of relapsed/refractory NPM1-mutated AML remains challenging, with the majority of patients eventually dying due to disease progression. Moreover, the prognosis is particularly poor in elderly and unfit patients, mainly because they cannot receive intensive treatment. Therefore, alternative treatment strategies are needed. Dactinomycin is a low-cost chemotherapeutic agent, which has been anecdotally reported to induce remission in NPM1-mutated patients, although its mechanism of action remains unclear. Here, we describe the results of a single-center phase 2 pilot study investigating the safety and efficacy of single-agent dactinomycin in relapsed/refractory NPM1-mutated adult AML patients, demonstrating that this drug can induce complete responses and is relatively well tolerated. We also provide evidence that the activity of dactinomycin associates with nucleolar stress both in vitro and in vivo in patients. Finally, we show that low-dose dactinomycin generates more efficient stress response in cells expressing NPM1 mutant compared to wild-type cells, suggesting that NPM1-mutated AML may be more sensitive to nucleolar stress.

{"input": "GABA-Transaminase Deficiency\n GABA-transaminase deficiency, also known as gamma-amino butyric acid transaminase (GABA-T) deficiency, is an extremely rare autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism (IEM) that is caused by a defect in the ABAT gene, which codes for 4-aminobutyrate (GABA) aminotransferase. This enzyme is present in several tissues in addition to brain and is most active in liver, and it catalyzes the conversion of GABA and 2-oxoglutarate into succinic semialdehyde and L-glutamate, and when it is deficient, GABA levels in the body, specifically the cerebrospinal fluid, are elevated. GABA is a neurotransmitter found in the nervous system that inhibits neurons from firing, and also affects the development of the brain, as well as regulating muscle tone. GABA-T can also convert beta-alanine and oxoglutaric acid to L-glutamic acid and malonic semialdehyde as part of the beta-alanine metabolism pathway, and when it is mutated, leads to an accumulation of beta-alanine within the cell. GABA-T deficiency is characterized by an increase of GABA levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. Symptoms of this disorder include low muscle tone and psychomotor retardation, as well as potential epilepsy and excessive sleeping. Treatment with Flumanezil, sold as Anexate, Lanexat, Mazicon or Romazicon, a GABA-A antagonist, has been tested and may be beneficial in some cases, and potentially more effective if started at a young age. It is estimated that GABA-T deficiency affects less than 1 in 1,000,000 individuals, as only five cases have been reported in literature as of 2017.", "output": [["GABA-Transaminase Deficiency", "causes", "elevated GABA levels in the body"], ["GABA-Transaminase Deficiency", "causes", "low muscle tone"], ["GABA-Transaminase Deficiency", "causes", "psychomotor retardation"], ["GABA-Transaminase Deficiency", "causes", "epilepsy"], ["GABA-Transaminase Deficiency", "causes", "excessive sleeping"], ["GABA-Transaminase Deficiency", "biolocation is", "cerebrospinal fluid"], ["GABA-Transaminase Deficiency", "biolocation is", "nervous system"], ["GABA-Transaminase Deficiency", "biolocation is", "brain"], ["GABA-Transaminase Deficiency", "sourced through", "ABAT gene"], ["GABA-Transaminase Deficiency", "involved in", "beta-alanine metabolism"], ["GABA-Transaminase Deficiency", "involved in", "neurotransmitter metabolism"], ["GABA-Transaminase Deficiency", "involved in", "brain development"], ["GABA-Transaminase Deficiency", "involved in", "muscle tone regulation"]], "output_complete": "\n          The task is to extract chemical-related triples from scientific research papers.\n          The rules are:\n          1.

It is estimated that GABA-T deficiency affects less than 1 in 1,000,000 individuals, as only five cases have been reported in literature as of 2017.\n\nA: [\"GABA-Transaminase Deficiency\", \"causes\", \"elevated GABA levels in the body\"],\n[\"GABA-Transaminase Deficiency\", \"causes\", \"low muscle tone\"],\n[\"GABA-Transaminase Deficiency\", \"causes\", \"psychomotor retardation\"],\n[\"GABA-Transaminase Deficiency\", \"causes\", \"epilepsy\"],\n[\"GABA-Transaminase Deficiency\", \"causes\", \"excessive sleeping\"],\n[\"GABA-Transaminase Deficiency\", \"biolocation is\", \"cerebrospinal fluid\"],\n[\"GABA-Transaminase Deficiency\", \"biolocation is\", \"nervous system\"],\n[\"GABA-Transaminase Deficiency\", \"biolocation is\", \"brain\"],\n[\"GABA-Transaminase Deficiency\", \"sourced through\", \"ABAT gene\"],\n[\"GABA-Transaminase Deficiency\", \"involved in\", \"beta-alanine metabolism\"],\n[\"GABA-Transaminase Deficiency\", \"involved in\", \"neurotransmitter metabolism\"],\n[\"GABA-Transaminase Deficiency\", \"involved in\", \"brain development\"],\n[\"GABA-Transaminase Deficiency\", \"involved in\", \"muscle tone regulation\"]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "valid": true}
{"input": "Vitamin B6 Metabolism As is commonly known there are many vitamins, the vitamin B complex group being one of the most well known. An important vitamin B complex group vitamin is vitamin B6, which is water-soluble. Moreover, this vitamin comes in various forms, one of which is an active form, known by the name pyridoxal phosphate or PLP. PLP serves as cofactor in a variety of reactions including from amino acid metabolism, (in particular in reactions such as transamination, deamination, and decarboxylation). To complicate matters however, there are in fact seven alternate forms of this same vitamin. These include pyridoxine (PN), pyridoxine 5\u2019-phosphate (PNP), pyridoxal (PL), pyridoxamine (PM), pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate (PMP), 4-pyridoxic acid (PA), and the aforementioned pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate (PLP). One of these forms, PA, is in fact a catabolite whose presence is found in excreted urine. For a person to absorb some of these active forms of vitamin B6 such as PLP or PMP they must first be dephosphorylized. This done via an alkaline enzyme phosphatase. There are a wide variety of biproducts from the metabolism in question, most of which find there ways into the urine and from there are excreted. One such biproduct is 4-pyridoxic acid. In fact this last biproduct is found in such large quantities that estimates of vitamin B6 metabolism birproducts show that 4-pyridoxic acid is as much as 40-60% of all the biproducts.Of course, it is not the only product of metabolism.

{"input": "P-hydroxyphenylacetic acid concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid Using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and electrochemical detection with a rapid one-step purification on Sephadex G-10 column, we have developed a sensitive technique to measure p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (PHPA), the oxidatively deaminated metabolite of p-tyramine, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The method has been shown to offer simplicity, high sensitivity and low cost for the analysis of PHPA. By using this method PHPA can be measured concurrently with the dopamine metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA), in small amounts of CSF (0.5 ml or less). The concentrations of PHPA ranged 4.2 to 17.0 ng/ml with a mean value of 7.8 ng/ml+/-1.1 SEM in lumbar CSF of non-neurological control patients. PHPA value is consistent with the results of earlier studies using different methods. PHPA concentrations in both schizophrenic (4.7+/-0.6 ng/ml, n=11) and epileptic patients (5.8+/-0.4 ng/ml, n=28) were significantly lower than those in control patients. A concentration gradient of PHPA was found along the ventricular-lumbar axis. Probenecid markedly increased PHPA in lumbar CSF. These observations suggest that PHPA in lumbar CSF is derived at least in part from the brain and eliminated from CSF by a probenecid-sensitive transport mechanism. There was a significant correlation between PHPA and HVA concentrations in CSF. This is an interesting finding since a reciprocal relationship between dopamine turnover and p-tyramine concentrations has been found in the striatum of experimental animals. A number of recent studies suggest that p-tyramine may act as neurotransmitter or neuromodulator in specific neuronal systems. The present method should be useful in clinical investigations to clarify a functional role of p-tyramine in the brain.", "output": [["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "sourced through", "reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "sourced through", "electrochemical detection"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "sourced through", "Sephadex G-10 column"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"], ["p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid", "causes", "cancer"]], "output_complete": "\n          The task is to extract chemical-related triples from scientific research papers.\n          The rules are:\n          1.

{"input": "Pharmacokinetic Profile, Safety, and Tolerability of Clascoterone (Cortexolone 17-alpha propionate, CB-03-01) Topical Cream, 1% in Subjects With Acne Vulgaris: An Open-Label Phase 2a Study Clascoterone (cortexolone 17\u03b1-propionate, CB-03-01) 1% cream, a topical, androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor under investigation for the treatment of acne vulgaris, is rapidly metabolized to cortexolone in human plasma. The primary objectives of this study were to determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and adrenal suppression potential of clascoterone topical cream, 1% in subjects with acne vulgaris. Study Design: This study was an open-label, multicenter study in 42 subjects \u226512 years of age with moderate-to-severe acne (Grade 3-4 on the Investigator\u2019s Global Assessment [IGA]), on the face, chest and/or back. Cohort 1(>18 years of age) and Cohort 2 (12-18 years of age) applied clascoterone topical cream, 1% twice daily (BID) for 14 days. Primary safety endpoints included hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response to cosyntropin via a Cosyntropin Stimulation Test (CST) upon screening (day 1) and at day 14 (HPA axis suppression was defined as a post-stimulation serum cortisol level <18 \u03bcg/dL at day 14); and PK evaluation including concentration-time profiles of clascoterone and cortexolone in plasma\u2014PK parameters were determined using \u201cnon-compartmental\u201d analysis. Secondary safety endpoints included clinical laboratory testing, local and systemic adverse events (AEs), physical examination/vital signs, and electrocardiogram (ECG). Results: 42 subjects (Cohort 1=20, Cohort 2= 22) enrolled. Cohort 1 was comprised of 15 females (15/20, 75%) and 5 males (5/20, 25%), non-Hispanic/Latino (20/20, 100%), mean age is 24.4 years. Cohort 2 was comprised of 12 females (12/22, 54.5%) and 10 males (10/22, 45.5%), non-Hispanic/Latino (21/22, 95.5%), and mean age is 15.6 years. Three subjects (3/42,7%), 1 adult and 2 adolescents, demonstrated an abnormal HPA axis response with post-stimulation serum cortisol levels ranging from 14.9 to 17.7 \u03bcg/dL at day 14. All returned to normal HPA axis function, four weeks after day 14. None showed clinical evidence of adrenal suppression. Clascoterone plasma concentrations achieved PK steady-state by day 5. Clascoterone systemic exposure was similar between both cohorts. At steady-state, plasma concentrations increased ~1.8 to 2.1 fold versus first dose with mean (coefficient of variation [CV] %) maximum plasma concentrations of 4.4 ng/mL (67%) and 4.6 ng/mL (103%) in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, respectively. Cortexolone plasma concentrations trended below the lower limit of quantitation (0.5 ng/mL) in both cohorts. Local skin reactions (LSRs) were mostly mild, with only one moderate case of pruritus. There were nine AEs categorized as follows: definitely related (N=2), probably related (N=4), unlikely/not related (N=3), to clascoterone. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the safety and tolerability of clascoterone topical cream, 1% in adolescents and adults with acne vulgaris treated BID for 14 consecutive days.

Cohort 2 was comprised of 12 females (12/22, 54.5%) and 10 males (10/22, 45.5%), non-Hispanic/Latino (21/22, 95.5%), and mean age is 15.6 years. Three subjects (3/42,7%), 1 adult and 2 adolescents, demonstrated an abnormal HPA axis response with post-stimulation serum cortisol levels ranging from 14.9 to 17.7 \u03bcg/dL at day 14. All returned to normal HPA axis function, four weeks after day 14. None showed clinical evidence of adrenal suppression. Clascoterone plasma concentrations achieved PK steady-state by day 5. Clascoterone systemic exposure was similar between both cohorts. At steady-state, plasma concentrations increased ~1.8 to 2.1 fold versus first dose with mean (coefficient of variation [CV] %) maximum plasma concentrations of 4.4 ng/mL (67%) and 4.6 ng/mL (103%) in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, respectively. Cortexolone plasma concentrations trended below the lower limit of quantitation (0.5 ng/mL) in both cohorts. Local skin reactions (LSRs) were mostly mild, with only one moderate case of pruritus. There were nine AEs categorized as follows: definitely related (N=2), probably related (N=4), unlikely/not related (N=3), to clascoterone. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the safety and tolerability of clascoterone topical cream, 1% in adolescents and adults with acne vulgaris treated BID for 14 consecutive days.

{"input": "Hyperprolactinaemia is associated with a higher prevalence of pituitary-adrenal dysfunction in non-functioning pituitary macroadenoma In non-functioning pituitary macroadenoma (NFMA), hyperprolactinaemia (hyperPRL) is considered to be a sign of hypothalamic-pituitary dysregulation, but it is unknown whether hyperPRL is associated with an increased frequency of pituitary hormone deficiencies. Forty consecutive patients with histology-proven NFMA were studied and hyperPRL was defined as serum prolactin (PRL) > 200 mIU/l in men and > 600 mIU/l in women. The pituitary-adrenal axis was evaluated by measurement of urinary free cortisol (N = 38), peak cortisol to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia (IIH, N = 36) and to human corticotrophin-releasing hormone (hCRF, N = 40) and by urinary tetrahydrol 11-deoxycortisol (H4S, N = 39), plasma androstenedione increment (N = 39) and serum 11-deoxycortisol (N = 1) after metyrapone. Central hypothyroidism, gonadotrophin deficiency and growth hormone (GH) reserve were also assessed. Twenty patients had hyperPRL (serum PRL 331 (223-1120) mIU/l (median, range) in men and 932 (660-3927) mIU/l in women): urinary free cortisol excretion (p < 0.03) and peak serum cortisol in response to IIH (p < 0.02) were lower in hyperPRL than in normoPRL patients; peak serum cortisol after hCRF was not different between groups but occurred later in hyperPRL patients (at 60vs 30 min, p < 0.03); urinary H4S excretion and androstenedione response after metyrapone were lower in hyperPRL than in normoPRL patients (p < 0.05 for both): 60% of hyperPRL patients and 15% of normoPRL patients had an abnormal H4S response (p < 0.025): central hypothyroidism (overt + subclinical) was present in 74% of hyperPRL and in 60% of normoPRL patients (NS); 78% of hyperPRL and 55% of normoPRL patients had gonadotrophin deficiency (NS): growth hormone (GH) deficiency was present in 83% of hyperPRL and in 89% of normoPRL patients (NS); 73.3% of 75 evaluable pituitary hormone axes were abnormal in hyperPRL patients compared to 53.8% of 78 hormone axes in normoPRL patients (by metyrapone test to examine adrenal function, p < 0.025); and no significant differences in tumour grade and stage distribution were found between hyperPRL and normoPRL patients.

Twenty patients had hyperPRL (serum PRL 331 (223-1120) mIU/l (median, range) in men and 932 (660-3927) mIU/l in women): urinary free cortisol excretion (p < 0.03) and peak serum cortisol in response to IIH (p < 0.02) were lower in hyperPRL than in normoPRL patients; peak serum cortisol after hCRF was not different between groups but occurred later in hyperPRL patients (at 60vs 30 min, p < 0.03); urinary H4S excretion and androstenedione response after metyrapone were lower in hyperPRL than in normoPRL patients (p < 0.05 for both): 60% of hyperPRL patients and 15% of normoPRL patients had an abnormal H4S response (p < 0.025): central hypothyroidism (overt + subclinical) was present in 74% of hyperPRL and in 60% of normoPRL patients (NS); 78% of hyperPRL and 55% of normoPRL patients had gonadotrophin deficiency (NS): growth hormone (GH) deficiency was present in 83% of hyperPRL and in 89% of normoPRL patients (NS); 73.3% of 75 evaluable pituitary hormone axes were abnormal in hyperPRL patients compared to 53.8% of 78 hormone axes in normoPRL patients (by metyrapone test to examine adrenal function, p < 0.025); and no significant differences in tumour grade and stage distribution were found between hyperPRL and normoPRL patients. It is concluded that hyper-prolactinaemia in NFMA is associated with a higher prevalence of pituitary-adrenal dysfunction, which is likely to be explained at least in part by functional hypothalamic-pituitary interruption.\n          A: [\"Hyperprolactinaemia\", \"causes\", \"Pituitary-adrenal dysfunction\"],\n          [\"Hyperprolactinaemia\", \"biolocation is\", \"Non-functioning pituitary macroadenoma\"]\n          A: [\"Hyperprolactinaemia\", \"biolocation is\", \"Non-functioning pituitary macroadenoma\"]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "valid": true}
{"input": "nan \talpha-Ketoisovaleric acid is an abnormal metabolite that arises from the incomplete breakdown of branched-chain amino acids. alpha-Ketoisovaleric acid is a neurotoxin, an acidogen, and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin causes damage to nerve cells and nerve tissues. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of alpha-ketoisovaleric acid are associated with maple syrup urine disease. MSUD is a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC), leading to a buildup of the branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and their toxic by-products (ketoacids) in the blood and urine. The symptoms of MSUD often show in infancy and lead to severe brain damage if untreated. MSUD may also present later depending on the severity of the disease. If left untreated in older individuals, during times of metabolic crisis, symptoms of the condition include uncharacteristically inappropriate, extreme, or erratic behaviour and moods, hallucinations, anorexia, weight loss, anemia, diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, lethargy, oscillating hypertonia and hypotonia, ataxia, seizures, hypoglycemia, ketoacidosis, opisthotonus, pancreatitis, rapid neurological decline, and coma. In maple syrup urine disease, the brain concentration of branched-chain ketoacids can increase 10- to 20-fold. This leads to a depletion of glutamate and a consequent reduction in the concentration of brain glutamine, aspartate, alanine, and other amino acids. The result is a compromise of energy metabolism because of a failure of the malate-aspartate shuttle and a diminished rate of protein synthesis (PMID: 15930465 ). alpha-Ketoisovaleric acid is a keto-acid, which is a subclass of organic acids. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart, liver, and kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of untreated MSUD.

Purine is a bicyclic aromatic compound made up of a pyrimidine ring fused to an imidazole ring. Adenine forms adenosine, a nucleoside, when attached to ribose, and deoxyadenosine when attached to deoxyribose, and it forms adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a nucleotide, when three phosphate groups are added to adenosine. Adenine is a drug which is used for nutritional supplementation, also for treating dietary shortage or imbalance. Adenine is a strong basic compound (based on its pKa). Adenosine triphosphate is used in cellular metabolism as one of the basic methods of transferring chemical energy between reactions. Adenine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to humans. In individuals suspected of suffering from a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), adenosine is used to help identify the rhythm. In humans, adenine is involved in riboflavin metabolism. Adenine is a potentially toxic compound. Adenine (sometimes known as vitamin B4) combines with the sugar ribose to form adenosine, which in turn can be bonded with from one to three phosphoric acid units, yielding AMP, ADP and ATP . A modified form of adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) is an imporant secondary messenger in the propagation of many hormonal stimuli. Adenine is an integral part of the structure of many coenzymes.

{"input": "Engineering of a novel biochemical pathway for the biosynthesis of l-2-aminobutyric acid in Escherichia coli K12 Abstract\nl-2-Aminobutyric acid was synthesised in a transamination reaction from l-threonine and l-aspartic acid as substrates in a whole cell biotransformation using recombinant Escherichia coli K12. The cells contained the cloned genes tyrB, ilvA and alsS which respectively encode tyrosine aminotransferase of E. coli, threonine deaminase of E. coli and \u03b1-acetolactate synthase of B. subtilis 168. The 2-aminobutyric acid was produced by the action of the aminotransferase on 2-ketobutyrate and l-aspartate. The 2-ketobutyrate is generated in situ from l-threonine by the action of the deaminase, and the pyruvate by-product is eliminated by the acetolactate synthase. The concerted action of the three enzymes offers significant yield and purity advantages over the process using the transaminase alone with an eight to tenfold increase in the ratio of product to the major impurity.\nIntroduction\nEnzymatic transamination is involved directly or indirectly in the biosynthesis of most\nproteinogenic amino acids.1 Biochemical studies on the transaminases (aminotransferases) of bacteria have revealed that in many cases the major transaminases can each participate in the synthesis of a variety of amino acids with quite divergent side chain structure. For example, the aromatic aminotransferase of E. coli is capable of synthesising aspartate and leucine in addition to the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine. Similarly, the E. coli branched chain transaminase can synthesise phenylalanine and methionine in addition to the branched chain amino acids, isoleucine, leucine and valine.2 The relatively relaxed substrate specificity of microbial transaminases has been useful in the development of biotransformation approaches for the synthesis of non-proteinogenic amino acids, which are now in increasing demand as intermediates for the synthesis of peptidomimetic pharmaceuticals. Transaminases possess additional features appropriate for efficient biocatalysts, including high turnover numbers and no requirement for external cofactor recycling. A number of compounds including l-2-aminobutyric acid and l-tertiary leucine have now been produced using transaminase-based biotransformations.3, 4\nIn addition to the identification of the appropriate biosynthetic enzyme, the feasibility of all biotransformation processes depends heavily upon other criteria such as the availability of inexpensive starting materials, the reaction yield and the complexity of product recovery. In the case of transaminase processes, the reversible nature of the reaction as shown in Figure 1 and the presence of a keto acid by-product is a concern which limits the overall yield and purity of product, and has led to efforts to increase the conversion beyond the typical 50% yield of product.5, 6 Additionally, there are cost considerations in the large scale preparation of keto acid substrates such as 2-ketobutyrate, which are not commodity chemicals.\nTo address these issues we have engineered a synthetic biochemical pathway to enhance the biosynthesis of 2-aminobutyrate using a microbial transaminase. The engineered E. coli incorporates the cloned E. coli K12 ilvA gene encoding threonine deaminase to generate 2-ketobutyrate from the commodity amino acid l-threonine, and the cloned alsS gene of B. subtilis 168 which eliminates pyruvate, the keto acid by-product of the reaction, through the formation of non-reactive acetolactate. The effect of the concerted action of these three enzymes on the overall biosynthesis of 2-aminobutyrate and the potential broader application of this type of biochemical engineering is described in this article.\nSection snippets\nCloning and expression of biocatalyst genes\nPlasmid pIF347 carries the cloned ilvA gene of E. coli K12.

{"input": "3-Hydroxyisobutyrate, A Strong Marker of Insulin\nResistance in Type 2 Diabetes and Obesity That Modulates\nWhite and Brown Adipocyte Metabolism Circulating branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) associate with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. 3-Hydroxyisobutyrate (3-HIB) is a catabolic intermediate of the BCAA valine. In this study, we show that in a cohort of 4,942 men and women, circulating 3-HIB is elevated according to levels of hyperglycemia and established type 2 diabetes. In complementary cohorts with measures of insulin resistance, we found positive correlates for circulating 3-HIB concentrations with HOMA2 of insulin resistance, as well as a transient increase in 3-HIB followed by a marked decrease after bariatric surgery and weight loss. During differentiation, both white and brown adipocytes upregulate BCAA utilization and release increasing amounts of 3-HIB. Knockdown of the 3-HIB\u2013forming enzyme 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase decreases release of 3-HIB and lipid accumulation in both cell types. Conversely, addition of 3-HIB to white and brown adipocyte cultures increases fatty acid uptake and modulated insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in a time-dependent manner. Finally, 3-HIB treatment decreases mitochondrial oxygen consumption and generation of reactive oxygen species in white adipocytes, while increasing these measures in brown adipocytes. Our data establish 3-HIB as a novel adipocyte-derived regulator of adipocyte subtypespecific functions strongly linked to obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by elevated circulating glucose and HbA1c, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and increased body fat mass, especially in the intra-abdominal region (1,2). Risk factors for type 2 diabetes include excessive caloric intake, central obesity with increased waist-to-hip ratio, sedentary lifestyle, increasing age, and multiple genetic factors (3,4).

In this study, we show that in a cohort of 4,942 men and women, circulating 3-HIB is elevated according to levels of hyperglycemia and established type 2 diabetes. In complementary cohorts with measures of insulin resistance, we found positive correlates for circulating 3-HIB concentrations with HOMA2 of insulin resistance, as well as a transient increase in 3-HIB followed by a marked decrease after bariatric surgery and weight loss. During differentiation, both white and brown adipocytes upregulate BCAA utilization and release increasing amounts of 3-HIB. Knockdown of the 3-HIB\u2013forming enzyme 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase decreases release of 3-HIB and lipid accumulation in both cell types. Conversely, addition of 3-HIB to white and brown adipocyte cultures increases fatty acid uptake and modulated insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in a time-dependent manner. Finally, 3-HIB treatment decreases mitochondrial oxygen consumption and generation of reactive oxygen species in white adipocytes, while increasing these measures in brown adipocytes. Our data establish 3-HIB as a novel adipocyte-derived regulator of adipocyte subtypespecific functions strongly linked to obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by elevated circulating glucose and HbA1c, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and increased body fat mass, especially in the intra-abdominal region (1,2). Risk factors for type 2 diabetes include excessive caloric intake, central obesity with increased waist-to-hip ratio, sedentary lifestyle, increasing age, and multiple genetic factors (3,4). The insulin resistance and dyslipidemia associated with type 2 diabetes involve increased circulating triacylglycerols (TAG) and reduced HDL cholesterol (HDL-C).

{"input": "Metabolomics and metabolic pathway networks from human colorectal cancers, adjacent mucosa, and stool Abstract\nBackground: Colorectal cancers (CRC) are associated with perturbations in cellular amino acids, nucleotides, pentose-phosphate pathway carbohydrates, and glycolytic, gluconeogenic, and tricarboxylic acid intermediates. A non-targeted global metabolome approach was utilized for exploring human CRC, adjacent mucosa, and stool. In this pilot study, we identified metabolite profile differences between CRC and adjacent mucosa from patients undergoing colonic resection. Metabolic pathway analyses further revealed relationships between complex networks of metabolites.\nMethods: Seventeen CRC patients participated in this pilot study and provided CRC, adjacent mucosa ~10 cm proximal to the tumor, and stool. Metabolomes were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). All of the library standard identifications were confirmed and further analyzed via MetaboLync(TM) for metabolic network interactions.\nResults: There were a total of 728 distinct metabolites identified from colonic tissue and stool matrices. Nineteen metabolites significantly distinguished CRC from adjacent mucosa in our patient-matched cohort. Glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate demonstrated 0.64-fold and 0.75-fold lower expression in CRC compared to mucosa, respectively, whereas isobar: betaine aldehyde, N-methyldiethanolamine, and adenylosuccinate had 2.68-fold and 1.88-fold higher relative abundance in CRC. Eleven of the 19 metabolites had not previously been reported for CRC relevance. Metabolic pathway analysis revealed significant perturbations of short-chain fatty acid metabolism, fructose, mannose, and galactose metabolism, and glycolytic, gluconeogenic, and pyruvate metabolism. In comparison to the 500 stool metabolites identified from human CRC patients, only 215 of those stool metabolites were also detected in tissue. This CRC and stool metabolome investigation identified novel metabolites that may serve as key small molecules in CRC pathogenesis, confirmed the results from previously reported CRC metabolome studies, and showed networks for metabolic pathway aberrations. In addition, we found differences between the CRC and stool metabolomes.\nConclusions: Stool metabolite profiles were limited for direct associations with CRC and adjacent mucosa, yet metabolic pathways were conserved across both matrices. Larger patient-matched CRC, adjacent non-cancerous colonic mucosa, and stool cohort studies for metabolite profiling are needed to validate these small molecule differences and metabolic pathway aberrations for clinical application to CRC control, treatment, and prevention.\nKeywords: Cancer; Colon mucosa; Colorectal; Metabolic pathways; Metabolites; Metabolomics; Stool; Tumor.\n", "output": [["Metabolomics", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"], ["MetaboLync(TM)", "sourced through", "MetaboLync(TM)"]], "output_complete": "\n          The task is to extract chemical-related triples from scientific research papers.\n          The rules are:\n          1.
