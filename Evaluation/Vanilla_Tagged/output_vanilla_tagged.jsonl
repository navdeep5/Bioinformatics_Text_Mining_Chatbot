Therefore, it is crucial to explore alternative sources of <CHEMICAL>L-Methionine</CHEMICAL> for dietary supplementation.\n\nMethods: In this study, we investigated three alternative sources of <CHEMICAL>L-Methionine</CHEMICAL>: <source>Caraway</source> (Carum carvi), <source>Sourdock</source> (<CHEMICAL>Rumex acetosa</CHEMICAL>), and <<source>food</source>><source>Tea</source> <organoleptic_effect>leaf</organoleptic_effect> willow</<source>food</source>> (Salix phylicifolia). We analyzed the content of <CHEMICAL>L-Methionine</CHEMICAL> in these plants using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and compared it with traditional sources. Additionally, we evaluated the potential of these alternative sources for large-scale production and sustainability.\n\nResults: Our findings showed that <source>Caraway</source> contained a significant amount of <CHEMICAL>L-Methionine</CHEMICAL> (1.16 g/100 g <organoleptic_effect>dry</organoleptic_effect> weight), followed by <source>Sourdock</source> (0.89 g/100 g <organoleptic_effect>dry</organoleptic_effect> weight) and <<source>food</source>><source>Tea</source> <organoleptic_effect>leaf</organoleptic_effect> willow</<source>food</source>> (0.74 g/100 g <organoleptic_effect>dry</organoleptic_effect> weight).

Dysregulation of <process>lipid transport</process> can lead to various diseases such as <health_effect>atherosclerosis</health_effect> and <DISEASE>diabetes</DISEASE>. Therefore, identifying novel <process>lipid transport</process> inhibitors is crucial for developing new therapeutic strategies. In this study, we investigated the potential of four <organoleptic_effect>natural</organoleptic_effect> products as <process>lipid transport</process> inhibitors.\n\nMethods: The four <organoleptic_effect>natural</organoleptic_effect> products, 9-Acetoxyfukinanolide, 1-Formylneogrifolin, <CHEMICAL>Linalyl formate</CHEMICAL>, and Methoxybauerenol, were isolated and purified from <source>plant</source> sources.

The inhibitory effects of these compounds on <process>lipid transport</process> were evaluated using an in vitro <process>lipid transport</process> assay.\n\nResults: Our results showed that all four compounds exhibited significant inhibitory effects on <process>lipid transport</process>. The most potent inhibitor was found to be 9-Acetoxyfukinanolide, with an IC50 value of 3.4 \u03bcM.

Additionally, we performed lipidomic analyses to identify changes in lipid composition and metabolism.\n\nResults:\nOur results demonstrate that <CHEMICAL>LysoPA</CHEMICAL> is involved in <process>cardiolipin biosynthesis</process> through its interaction with specific cardiolipin species.
