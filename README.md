# Bioinformatics Text-Mining System

The **Bioinformatics Text-Mining System** is a comprehensive platform designed for extracting, generating, and fine-tuning chemical abstracts and information from large datasets. Leveraging SQL databases, state-of-the-art language models, and advanced evaluation metrics, this system streamlines the extraction and analysis of chemical data for research and development purposes.

## Overview

This system encompasses a series of processes, from data extraction to model evaluation, aimed at efficiently handling chemical information:

- **Data Extraction**: Utilizing SQL, the system extracts data from ChemFOnt and transforms it into triplets for further analysis.
- **Abstract Generation**: Leveraging Mistral-7b-OpenOrca and GPT-3.5-Turbo, the system generates abstracts based on the extracted triplets.
- **Model Fine-Tuning**: Using the generated abstracts, the system fine-tunes models such as Starling-7B-Alpha and Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-V0.1 to enhance their ability to process chemical articles and return relevant information.
- **Evaluation**: The system evaluates the performance of the fine-tuned models using standard metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-score, along with novel metrics like bonus Precision and bonus Recall. Additionally, Jaro-Winkler similarity is employed for text similarity comparison. The fine-tuned Mixtral achieves a notable false positive percentage of 8%, surpassing GPT-3.5-Turbo.

## Files

- **Abstract_Generation**: Contains abstracts generated by Mistral-7b-OpenOrca and GPT-3.5-Turbo.
- **ChemFont_Tagger_Files**: Edited version of the ChemFont_Tagging directory, containing text files for all predicates in ChemFOnt.
- **Clusters**: Files containing different clustered variations of the abstracts/triplets.
- **Data**: Includes all training and test sets used in the system.
- **Evaluation**: Holds all resulting evaluations and graphs generated during model evaluation.
- **Finetune**: Contains fine-tuning scripts utilized in the system.
